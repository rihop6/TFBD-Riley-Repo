She was a\\n', '      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\\n', '      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\\n', '      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\\n', '      solace was visiting and news.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 2\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\n', '      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\n', '      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\n', '      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\\n', '      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\\n', '      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\\n', '      with,\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\\n', '      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\\n', '      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\\n', '      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\n', '      have no opinion of her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\\n', '      you do not depend on her serving you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\\n', '      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n', '\\n', '      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\\n', '      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\\n', '      times them ill.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\\n', '      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\n', '\\n', '      “To-morrow fortnight.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\\n', '      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to\\n', '      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\n', '      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\n', '      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is\\n', '      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\\n', '      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\\n', '      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\\n', '      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\\n', '      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\n', '      “Nonsense, nonsense!”\\n', '\\n', '      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\\n', '      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\\n', '      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\\n', '      _there_. What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep\\n', '      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\n', '\\n', '      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\\n', '      to Mr. Bingley.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so\\n', '      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not\\n', '      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\n', '      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\n', '\\n', '      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first\\n', '      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\n', '      had expected all the while.\\n', '\\n', '      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\n', '      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\n', '      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\n', '      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and\\n', '      never said a word about it till now.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\\n', '      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\n', '      raptures of his wife.\\n', '\\n', '      “What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the\\n', '      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends\\n', '      for his kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of\\n', '      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\n', '      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\n', '      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\\n', '      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\n', '      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\\n', '\\n', '      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\n', '      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\\n', '      ask him to dinner.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 3\\n', '\\n', '      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\n', '      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\n', '      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\n', '      They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions,\\n', '      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\n', '      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the\\n', '      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\\n', '      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\\n', '      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\n', '      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\\n', '      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\\n', '      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\\n', '      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\\n', '\\n', '      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\n', '      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\\n', '      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\\n', '\\n', '      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\\n', '      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\\n', '      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\\n', '      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\\n', '      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\\n', '      ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and\\n', '      rode a black horse.\\n', '\\n', '      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\n', '      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\n', '      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\\n', '      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\\n', '      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their\\n', '      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\\n', '      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\\n', '      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\\n', '      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\n', '      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\n', '      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\\n', '      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\\n', '      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\\n', '      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\\n', '      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\\n', '      that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from\\n', '      London, his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\\n', '      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Mr.\\n', '      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\\n', '      young man.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\n', '      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\\n', '      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\\n', '      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\\n', '      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\\n', '      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\\n', '      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\\n', '      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\\n', '      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\\n', '      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\n', '      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\\n', '      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to\\n', '      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\n', '      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\n', '      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\\n', '      compared with his friend.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\n', '      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\n', '      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\\n', '      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\\n', '      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\\n', '      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\\n', '      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\n', '      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\\n', '      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\\n', '      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\n', '      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\\n', '      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\\n', '      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\n', '      daughters.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\\n', '      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\n', '      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a\\n', '      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\\n', '      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\n', '\\n', '      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\n', '      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\\n', '      better dance.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\n', '      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\\n', '      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\\n', '      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\n', '      punishment to me to stand up with.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley,\\n', '      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\\n', '      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\\n', '      them you see uncommonly pretty.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\\n', '      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\\n', '      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\\n', '      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\\n', '      to introduce you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at\\n', '      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\\n', '      said, “She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and I\\n', '      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\\n', '      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\\n', '      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\\n', '      me.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\n', '      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She\\n', '      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\\n', '      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\\n', '      anything ridiculous.\\n', '\\n', '      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\\n', '      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\\n', '      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\\n', '      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\n', '      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\\n', '      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\n', '      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\\n', '      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet\\n', '      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\n', '      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\\n', '      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\\n', '      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\\n', '      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\\n', '      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\\n', '      rather hoped that all his wife’s views on the stranger would be\\n', '      disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story\\n', '      to hear.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\\n', '      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\\n', '      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\n', '      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\\n', '      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice. Only think of _that_,\\n', '      my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only\\n', '      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\\n', '      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her;\\n', '      but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\\n', '      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\n', '      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\\n', '      and asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with\\n', '      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\\n', '      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\\n', '      _Boulanger_—”\\n', '\\n', '      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\\n', '      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\\n', '      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\\n', '      ankle in the first dance!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\n', '      handsome! and his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\\n', '      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\\n', '      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”\\n', '\\n', '      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\n', '      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\\n', '      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\\n', '      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\\n', '      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\\n', '      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\\n', '      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\\n', '      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\\n', '      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\\n', '      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 4\\n', '\\n', '      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\n', '      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\n', '      sister how very much she admired him.\\n', '\\n', '      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\n', '      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\\n', '      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\\n', '\\n', '      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\\n', '      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\\n', '      thereby complete.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\n', '      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\\n', '      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\\n', '      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\\n', '      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\\n', '      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\\n', '      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\\n', '      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Dear Lizzy!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\n', '      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\\n', '      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\\n', '      human being in my life.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always\\n', '      speak what I think.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\\n', '      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\n', '      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one\\n', '      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\\n', '      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it\\n', '      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.\\n', '      And so, you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners\\n', '      are not equal to his.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when\\n', '      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,\\n', '      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a\\n', '      very charming neighbour in her.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\n', '      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\n', '      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\n', '      of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by\\n', '      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\n', '      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\n', '      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of\\n', '      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\\n', '      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first\\n', '      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\n', '      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and\\n', '      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every\\n', '      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of\\n', '      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of\\n', '      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\n', '      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired\\n', '      by trade.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\n', '      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\n', '      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it\\n', '      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was\\n', '      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was\\n', '      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his\\n', '      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at\\n', '      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\n', '\\n', '      His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own;\\n', '      but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\n', '      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.\\n', '      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\n', '      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\n', '      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by\\n', '      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did\\n', '      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the\\n', '      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner\\n', '      said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n', '\\n', '      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\n', '      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to\\n', '      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\n', '      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\n', '      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the\\n', '      strength of Darcy’s regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\n', '      of his judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was\\n', '      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was\\n', '      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\n', '      fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.\\n', '      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was\\n', '      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\n', '      giving offence.\\n', '\\n', '      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\n', '      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with\\n', '      pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\n', '      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\n', '      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as\\n', '      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\n', '      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\n', '      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\n', '      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either\\n', '      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\n', '      but she smiled too much.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they\\n', '      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,\\n', '      and one whom they should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet\\n', '      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt\\n', '      authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 5\\n', '\\n', '      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\\n', '      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been\\n', '      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable\\n', '      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to\\n', '      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been\\n', '      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business\\n', '      and to his residence in a small market town; and, quitting\\n', '      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile\\n', '      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\n', '      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled\\n', '      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the\\n', '      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\n', '      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\n', '      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation\\n', '      at St. James’s had made him courteous.\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\n', '      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The\\n', '      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about\\n', '      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.\\n', '\\n', '      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\\n', '      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the\\n', '      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\n', '      communicate.\\n', '\\n', '      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with\\n', '      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first\\n', '      choice.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\\n', '      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather\\n', '      believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know\\n', '      what—something about Mr. Robinson.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\\n', '      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\\n', '      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\\n', '      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he\\n', '      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\\n', '      question—‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt, there\\n', '      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem\\n', '      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”\\n', '      said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as\\n', '      his friend, is he?—Poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\n', '      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would\\n', '      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last\\n', '      night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once\\n', '      opening his lips.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said\\n', '      Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and\\n', '      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very\\n', '      angry at being spoke to.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much\\n', '      unless among his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is\\n', '      remarkably agreeable.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\n', '      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how\\n', '      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare\\n', '      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,\\n', '      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,\\n', '      “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with\\n', '      _him_, if I were you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with\\n', '      him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as\\n', '      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot\\n', '      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\n', '      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I\\n', '      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily\\n', '      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of\\n', '      her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\n', '      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\n', '      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\n', '      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\n', '      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\n', '      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\n', '      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without\\n', '      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,\\n', '      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came\\n', '      with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would\\n', '      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\n', '      your bottle directly.”\\n', '\\n', '      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\n', '      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 6\\n', '\\n', '      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The\\n', '      visit was returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing\\n', '      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and\\n', '      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger\\n', '      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted\\n', '      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane this\\n', '      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth\\n', '      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,\\n', '      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though\\n', '      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\n', '      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.\\n', '      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire\\n', '      her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to\\n', '      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the\\n', '      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she\\n', '      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered\\n', '      by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength\\n', '      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of\\n', '      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the\\n', '      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n', '\\n', '      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to\\n', '      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\n', '      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\\n', '      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\n', '      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\n', '      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\\n', '      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it\\n', '      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a\\n', '      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\n', '      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\n', '      In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_ affection\\n', '      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may\\n', '      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If\\n', '      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton\\n', '      indeed not to discover it too.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you\\n', '      do.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\n', '      conceal it, he must find it out.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley\\n', '      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours\\n', '      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed\\n', '      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in\\n', '      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every\\n', '      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is\\n', '      secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as\\n', '      much as she chooses.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is\\n', '      in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were\\n', '      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\n', '      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not\\n', '      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\n', '      degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness. She has known\\n', '      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;\\n', '      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined\\n', '      in company with him four times. This is not quite enough to make\\n', '      her understand his character.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she\\n', '      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\n', '      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent\\n', '      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\n', '      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to\\n', '      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has\\n', '      been unfolded.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\n', '      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had\\n', '      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his\\n', '      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\\n', '      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\\n', '      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does\\n', '      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\\n', '      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\\n', '      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\\n', '      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\\n', '      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\\n', '\\n', '      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\\n', '      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\n', '      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\\n', '      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\n', '      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\n', '      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\\n', '      clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good\\n', '      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\n', '      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\\n', '      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\n', '      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\\n', '      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\\n', '      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\\n', '      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\\n', '      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\\n', '      unaware;—to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\\n', '      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\n', '      with.\\n', '\\n', '      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\n', '      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\n', '      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\\n', '      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.\\n', '\\n', '      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\\n', '      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\n', '      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\\n', '      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\\n', '      of him.”\\n', '\\n', '      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\\n', '      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\\n', '      to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking\\n', '      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said,\\n', '\\n', '      “Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\n', '      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\\n', '      ball at Meryton?”\\n', '\\n', '      “With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady\\n', '      energetic.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are severe on us.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\\n', '      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\\n', '      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\\n', '      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\\n', '      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\\n', '      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\\n', '      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well; if it\\n', '      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\\n', '      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\\n', '      with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’—and I shall keep\\n', '      mine to swell my song.”\\n', '\\n', '      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\\n', '      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\\n', '      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\\n', '      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\\n', '      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\\n', '      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\n', '\\n', '      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\n', '      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\n', '      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\n', '      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\n', '      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\\n', '      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\\n', '      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\\n', '      request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases,\\n', '      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\\n', '      of the room.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\n', '      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\n', '      was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir\\n', '      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.\\n', '\\n', '      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\\n', '      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\\n', '      the first refinements of polished societies.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\n', '      amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Every savage\\n', '      can dance.”\\n', '\\n', '      Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\\n', '      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I\\n', '      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.\\n', '      Darcy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the\\n', '      sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Never, sir.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid\\n', '      it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You have a house in town, I conclude?”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy bowed.\\n', '\\n', '      “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am\\n', '      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that\\n', '      the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\\n', '\\n', '      He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not\\n', '      disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving\\n', '      towards them, he was struck with the notion of doing a very\\n', '      gallant thing, and called out to her,\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must\\n', '      allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable\\n', '      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much\\n', '      beauty is before you.” And, taking her hand, he would have given\\n', '      it to Mr. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not\\n', '      unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said\\n', '      with some discomposure to Sir William,\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I\\n', '      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg\\n', '      for a partner.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the\\n', '      honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor\\n', '      did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at\\n', '      persuasion.\\n', '\\n', '      “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to\\n', '      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman\\n', '      dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am\\n', '      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\\n', '\\n', '      “He is, indeed—but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss\\n', '      Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object\\n', '      to such a partner?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not\\n', '      injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with\\n', '      some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,\\n', '\\n', '      “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should imagine not.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\\n', '      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of\\n', '      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet\\n', '      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all\\n', '      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\\n', '      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great\\n', '      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman\\n', '      can bestow.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired\\n', '      he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such\\n', '      reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all\\n', '      astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray\\n', '      when am I to wish you joy?”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A\\n', '      lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to\\n', '      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be\\n', '      wishing me joy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\\n', '      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,\\n', '      indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with\\n', '      you.”\\n', '\\n', '      He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\\n', '      entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced\\n', '      her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 7\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of\\n', '      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was\\n', '      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and\\n', '      their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life,\\n', '      could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been\\n', '      an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.\\n', '\\n', '      She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk\\n', '      to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother\\n', '      settled in London in a respectable line of trade.\\n', '\\n', '      The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\\n', '      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually\\n', '      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to\\n', '      their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two\\n', '      youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly\\n', '      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than\\n', '      their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to\\n', '      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish\\n', '      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the\\n', '      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some\\n', '      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\\n', '      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia\\n', '      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,\\n', '      and Meryton was the headquarters.\\n', '\\n', '      Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most\\n', '      interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their\\n', '      knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings\\n', '      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the\\n', '      officers themselves. Mr. Philips visited them all, and this\\n', '      opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They\\n', '      could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large\\n', '      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was\\n', '      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an\\n', '      ensign.\\n', '\\n', '      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,\\n', '      Mr. Bennet coolly observed,\\n', '\\n', '      “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must\\n', '      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it\\n', '      some time, but I am now convinced.”\\n', '\\n', '      Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with\\n', '      perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of\\n', '      Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the\\n', '      day, as he was going the next morning to London.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be\\n', '      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think\\n', '      slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,\\n', '      however.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of\\n', '      it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not\\n', '      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every\\n', '      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two\\n', '      youngest daughters uncommonly foolish.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the\\n', '      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I\\n', '      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.\\n', '      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,\\n', '      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,\\n', '      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I\\n', '      shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked\\n', '      very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his\\n', '      regimentals.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and\\n', '      Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did\\n', '      when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in\\n', '      Clarke’s library.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman\\n', '      with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the\\n', '      servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with\\n', '      pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter\\n', '      read,\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say?\\n', '      Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\\n', '\\n', '      “MY DEAR FRIEND,—\\n', '      “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa\\n', '      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest\\n', '      of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women\\n', '      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the\\n', '      receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with\\n', '      the officers.—Yours ever,\\n', '\\n', '      “CAROLINE BINGLEY”\\n', '\\n', '      “With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell\\n', '      us of _that_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.\\n', '\\n', '      “No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems\\n', '      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure\\n', '      that they would not offer to send her home.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to\\n', '      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I had much rather go in the coach.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.\\n', '      They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”\\n', '\\n', '      “They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s\\n', '      purpose will be answered.”\\n', '\\n', '      She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the\\n', '      horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on\\n', '      horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many\\n', '      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane\\n', '      had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were\\n', '      uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued\\n', '      the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not\\n', '      come back.\\n', '\\n', '      “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more\\n', '      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.\\n', '      Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the\\n', '      felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a\\n', '      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for\\n', '      Elizabeth:\\n', '\\n', '      “MY DEAREST LIZZY,—\\n', '      “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to\\n', '      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends\\n', '      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also\\n', '      on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should\\n', '      hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and\\n', '      headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &c.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the\\n', '      note aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of\\n', '      illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it\\n', '      was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\\n', '      trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she\\n', '      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I\\n', '      could have the carriage.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her,\\n', '      though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no\\n', '      horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her\\n', '      resolution.\\n', '\\n', '      “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such\\n', '      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when\\n', '      you get there.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\\n', '      horses?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is\\n', '      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back\\n', '      by dinner.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but\\n', '      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my\\n', '      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is\\n', '      required.”\\n', '\\n', '      “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and\\n', '      Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young\\n', '      ladies set off together.\\n', '\\n', '      “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we\\n', '      may see something of Captain Carter before he goes.”\\n', '\\n', '      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings\\n', '      of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk\\n', '      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over\\n', '      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and\\n', '      finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary\\n', '      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of\\n', '      exercise.\\n', '\\n', '      She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\\n', '      assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of\\n', '      surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the\\n', '      day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible\\n', '      to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that\\n', '      they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very\\n', '      politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was\\n', '      something better than politeness; there was good humour and\\n', '      kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at\\n', '      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy\\n', '      which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the\\n', '      occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\\n', '      thinking only of his breakfast.\\n', '\\n', '      Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.\\n', '      Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and\\n', '      not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken\\n', '      to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the\\n', '      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note\\n', '      how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her\\n', '      entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and\\n', '      when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little\\n', '      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness\\n', '      she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.\\n', '\\n', '      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and\\n', '      Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much\\n', '      affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary\\n', '      came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be\\n', '      supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must\\n', '      endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed,\\n', '      and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily,\\n', '      for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.\\n', '      Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other\\n', '      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\\n', '      nothing to do elsewhere.\\n', '\\n', '      When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and\\n', '      very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage,\\n', '      and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane\\n', '      testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was\\n', '      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to\\n', '      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully\\n', '      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint\\n', '      the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 8\\n', '\\n', '      At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past\\n', '      six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries\\n', '      which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of\\n', '      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she\\n', '      could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means\\n', '      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four\\n', '      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a\\n', '      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;\\n', '      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference\\n', '      towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth\\n', '      to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\\n', '\\n', '      Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she\\n', '      could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was\\n', '      evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they\\n', '      prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed\\n', '      she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from\\n', '      any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister\\n', '      scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he\\n', '      was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at\\n', '      cards; who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout,\\n', '      had nothing to say to her.\\n', '\\n', '      When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss\\n', '      Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her\\n', '      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride\\n', '      and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.\\n', '      Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added,\\n', '\\n', '      “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an\\n', '      excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this\\n', '      morning. She really looked almost wild.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.\\n', '      Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering\\n', '      about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so\\n', '      untidy, so blowsy!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches\\n', '      deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been\\n', '      let down to hide it not doing its office.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this\\n', '      was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked\\n', '      remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her\\n', '      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley;\\n', '      “and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your\\n', '      sister_ make such an exhibition.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly not.”\\n', '\\n', '      “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever\\n', '      it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what\\n', '      could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort\\n', '      of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to\\n', '      decorum.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,”\\n', '      said Bingley.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half\\n', '      whisper, “that this adventure has rather affected your admiration\\n', '      of her fine eyes.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.”\\n', '      A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again.\\n', '\\n', '      “I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a\\n', '      very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well\\n', '      settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low\\n', '      connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\n', '      Meryton.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed\\n', '      heartily.\\n', '\\n', '      “If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried\\n', '      Bingley, “it would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men\\n', '      of any consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it\\n', '      their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at\\n', '      the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.\\n', '\\n', '      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room\\n', '      on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to\\n', '      coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit\\n', '      her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of\\n', '      seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than\\n', '      pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the\\n', '      drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was\\n', '      immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be\\n', '      playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse,\\n', '      said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\\n', '      below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather\\n', '      singular.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a\\n', '      great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried\\n', '      Elizabeth; “I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in\\n', '      many things.”\\n', '\\n', '      “In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said\\n', '      Bingley; “and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her\\n', '      quite well.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a\\n', '      table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to\\n', '      fetch her others; all that his library afforded.\\n', '\\n', '      “And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\\n', '      credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I\\n', '      have more than I ever looked into.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with\\n', '      those in the room.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have\\n', '      left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library\\n', '      you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\\n', '\\n', '      “It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many\\n', '      generations.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always\\n', '      buying books.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days\\n', '      as these.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the\\n', '      beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_\\n', '      house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I wish it may.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\\n', '      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is\\n', '      not a finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\\n', '\\n', '      “With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will\\n', '      sell it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\n', '      Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her\\n', '      very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly\\n', '      aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself\\n', '      between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.\\n', '\\n', '      “Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley;\\n', '      “will she be as tall as I am?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s\\n', '      height, or rather taller.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who\\n', '      delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!—and so\\n', '      extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the\\n', '      pianoforte is exquisite.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have\\n', '      patience to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\\n', '\\n', '      “All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you\\n', '      mean?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,\\n', '      and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this,\\n', '      and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first\\n', '      time, without being informed that she was very accomplished.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy,\\n', '      “has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who\\n', '      deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a\\n', '      screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your\\n', '      estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more\\n', '      than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that\\n', '      are really accomplished.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\\n', '\\n', '      “Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in\\n', '      your idea of an accomplished woman.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be\\n', '      really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is\\n', '      usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of\\n', '      music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to\\n', '      deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a\\n', '      certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of\\n', '      her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but\\n', '      half deserved.”\\n', '\\n', '      “All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she\\n', '      must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of\\n', '      her mind by extensive reading.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished\\n', '      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility\\n', '      of all this?”\\n', '\\n', '      “_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and\\n', '      taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice\\n', '      of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew\\n', '      many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called\\n', '      them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to\\n', '      what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an\\n', '      end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.\\n', '\\n', '      “Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed\\n', '      on her, “is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend\\n', '      themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with\\n', '      many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a\\n', '      paltry device, a very mean art.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly\\n', '      addressed, “there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies\\n', '      sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears\\n', '      affinity to cunning is despicable.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\\n', '      continue the subject.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was\\n', '      worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s\\n', '      being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no\\n', '      country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to\\n', '      town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not\\n', '      hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their\\n', '      brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be\\n', '      sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly\\n', '      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared\\n', '      that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\\n', '      however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better\\n', '      relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions\\n', '      that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her\\n', '      sister.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 9\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and\\n', '      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable\\n', '      answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr.\\n', '      Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two\\n', '      elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this\\n', '      amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to\\n', '      Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own\\n', '      judgment of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched,\\n', '      and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon\\n', '      after the family breakfast.\\n', '\\n', '      Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have\\n', '      been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her\\n', '      illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering\\n', '      immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove\\n', '      her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her\\n', '      daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the\\n', '      apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all\\n', '      advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\\n', '      Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three\\n', '      daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley\\n', '      met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet\\n', '      worse than she expected.\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too\\n', '      ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.\\n', '      We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister,\\n', '      I am sure, will not hear of her removal.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold\\n', '      civility, “that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention\\n', '      while she remains with us.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do\\n', '      not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed,\\n', '      and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the\\n', '      world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without\\n', '      exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell\\n', '      my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room\\n', '      here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.\\n', '      I do not know a place in the country that is equal to\\n', '      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\\n', '      hope, though you have but a short lease.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if\\n', '      I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in\\n', '      five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite\\n', '      fixed here.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said\\n', '      Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards\\n', '      her.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily\\n', '      seen through I am afraid is pitiful.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate\\n', '      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not\\n', '      run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you\\n', '      were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have\\n', '      at least that advantage.”\\n', '\\n', '      “The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few\\n', '      subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in\\n', '      a very confined and unvarying society.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new\\n', '      to be observed in them for ever.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of\\n', '      mentioning a country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite\\n', '      as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town.”\\n', '\\n', '      Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a\\n', '      moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had\\n', '      gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the\\n', '      country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The\\n', '      country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\\n', '\\n', '      “When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave\\n', '      it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have\\n', '      each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that\\n', '      gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was\\n', '      nothing at all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for\\n', '      her mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that\\n', '      there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the\\n', '      country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not\\n', '      meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there\\n', '      are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with\\n', '      four-and-twenty families.”\\n', '\\n', '      Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep\\n', '      his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her\\n', '      eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,\\n', '      for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother’s\\n', '      thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn\\n', '      since _her_ coming away.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man\\n', '      Sir William is, Mr. Bingley—is not he? so much the man of\\n', '      fashion! So genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to\\n', '      everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons\\n', '      who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,\\n', '      quite mistake the matter.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Did Charlotte dine with you?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the\\n', '      mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants\\n', '      that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up\\n', '      differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the\\n', '      Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity\\n', '      they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_\\n', '      plain—but then she is our particular friend.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas\\n', '      herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not\\n', '      like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not\\n', '      often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do\\n', '      not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was\\n', '      a gentleman at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her,\\n', '      that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before\\n', '      we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her\\n', '      too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty\\n', '      they were.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There\\n', '      has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder\\n', '      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away\\n', '      love!”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said\\n', '      Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '      “Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what\\n', '      is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of\\n', '      inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it\\n', '      entirely away.”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made\\n', '      Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself\\n', '      again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;\\n', '      and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks\\n', '      to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for\\n', '      troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil\\n', '      in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also,\\n', '      and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed\\n', '      without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\\n', '      soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the\\n', '      youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had\\n', '      been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the\\n', '      result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with\\n', '      having promised on his first coming into the country to give a\\n', '      ball at Netherfield.\\n', '\\n', '      Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine\\n', '      complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her\\n', '      mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early\\n', '      age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural\\n', '      self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom\\n', '      her uncle’s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended\\n', '      her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore,\\n', '      to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly\\n', '      reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\\n', '      shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to\\n', '      this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and\\n', '      when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the\\n', '      very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while\\n', '      she is ill.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes—it would be much\\n', '      better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely\\n', '      Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given\\n', '      _your_ ball,” she added, “I shall insist on their giving one\\n', '      also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he\\n', '      does not.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth\\n', '      returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’\\n', '      behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the\\n', '      latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in\\n', '      their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley’s witticisms\\n', '      on _fine eyes_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 10\\n', '\\n', '      The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and\\n', '      Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the\\n', '      invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the\\n', '      evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The\\n', '      loo table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and\\n', '      Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his\\n', '      letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to\\n', '      his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.\\n', '      Hurst was observing their game.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\\n', '      attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The\\n', '      perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting,\\n', '      or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter,\\n', '      with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received,\\n', '      formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her\\n', '      opinion of each.\\n', '\\n', '      “How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”\\n', '\\n', '      He made no answer.\\n', '\\n', '      “You write uncommonly fast.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course\\n', '      of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think\\n', '      them!”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to\\n', '      yours.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have already told her so once, by your desire.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I\\n', '      mend pens remarkably well.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Thank you—but I always mend my own.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How can you contrive to write so even?”\\n', '\\n', '      He was silent.\\n', '\\n', '      “Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on\\n', '      the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with\\n', '      her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it\\n', '      infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write\\n', '      again? At present I have not room to do them justice.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do\\n', '      you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”\\n', '\\n', '      “They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not\\n', '      for me to determine.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter\\n', '      with ease, cannot write ill.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her\\n', '      brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too\\n', '      much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”\\n', '\\n', '      “My style of writing is very different from yours.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless\\n', '      way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the\\n', '      rest.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by\\n', '      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my\\n', '      correspondents.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm\\n', '      reproof.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of\\n', '      humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes\\n', '      an indirect boast.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of\\n', '      modesty?”\\n', '\\n', '      “The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\\n', '      writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity\\n', '      of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not\\n', '      estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of\\n', '      doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the\\n', '      possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of\\n', '      the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if\\n', '      you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in\\n', '      five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of\\n', '      compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in\\n', '      a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,\\n', '      and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all\\n', '      the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon\\n', '      my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I\\n', '      believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume\\n', '      the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before\\n', '      the ladies.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that\\n', '      you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite\\n', '      as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you\\n', '      were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had\\n', '      better stay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would\\n', '      probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr.\\n', '      Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown\\n', '      him off now much more than he did himself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting\\n', '      what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my\\n', '      temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that\\n', '      gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think\\n', '      the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat\\n', '      denial, and ride off as fast as I could.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original\\n', '      intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must\\n', '      speak for himself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call\\n', '      mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,\\n', '      however, to stand according to your representation, you must\\n', '      remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire\\n', '      his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely\\n', '      desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of\\n', '      its propriety.”\\n', '\\n', '      “To yield readily—easily—to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no\\n', '      merit with you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “To yield without conviction is no compliment to the\\n', '      understanding of either.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence\\n', '      of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would\\n', '      often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for\\n', '      arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking\\n', '      of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as\\n', '      well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we\\n', '      discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general\\n', '      and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them\\n', '      is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great\\n', '      moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with\\n', '      the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to\\n', '      arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which\\n', '      is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of\\n', '      intimacy subsisting between the parties?”\\n', '\\n', '      “By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars,\\n', '      not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will\\n', '      have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be\\n', '      aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall\\n', '      fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so\\n', '      much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than\\n', '      Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his\\n', '      own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has\\n', '      nothing to do.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that\\n', '      he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss\\n', '      Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an\\n', '      expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.\\n', '\\n', '      “I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an\\n', '      argument, and want to silence this.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and\\n', '      Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall\\n', '      be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and\\n', '      Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\\n', '\\n', '      When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and\\n', '      Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved\\n', '      with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request\\n', '      that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and\\n', '      more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus\\n', '      employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over\\n', '      some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.\\n', '      Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose\\n', '      that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and\\n', '      yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still\\n', '      more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last, that she\\n', '      drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and\\n', '      reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other\\n', '      person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him\\n', '      too little to care for his approbation.\\n', '\\n', '      After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm\\n', '      by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing\\n', '      near Elizabeth, said to her—\\n', '\\n', '      “Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such\\n', '      an opportunity of dancing a reel?”\\n', '\\n', '      She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with\\n', '      some surprise at her silence.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh!” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\\n', '      determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say\\n', '      ‘Yes,’ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;\\n', '      but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and\\n', '      cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,\\n', '      therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to\\n', '      dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed I do not dare.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at\\n', '      his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness\\n', '      in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody;\\n', '      and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by\\n', '      her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of\\n', '      her connections, he should be in some danger.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her\\n', '      great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received\\n', '      some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by\\n', '      talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in\\n', '      such an alliance.\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the\\n', '      shrubbery the next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few\\n', '      hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage\\n', '      of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the\\n', '      younger girls of running after the officers. And, if I may mention so\\n', '      delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,\\n', '      bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady\\n', '      possesses.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be\\n', '      placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your\\n', '      great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,\\n', '      only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you\\n', '      must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to\\n', '      those beautiful eyes?”\\n', '\\n', '      “It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but\\n', '      their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,\\n', '      might be copied.”\\n', '\\n', '      At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and\\n', '      Elizabeth herself.\\n', '\\n', '      “I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in\\n', '      some confusion, lest they had been overheard.\\n', '\\n', '      “You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away\\n', '      without telling us that you were coming out.”\\n', '\\n', '      Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth\\n', '      to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt\\n', '      their rudeness, and immediately said,—\\n', '\\n', '      “This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go\\n', '      into the avenue.”\\n', '\\n', '      But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with\\n', '      them, laughingly answered,\\n', '\\n', '      “No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and\\n', '      appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by\\n', '      admitting a fourth. Good-bye.”\\n', '\\n', '      She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the\\n', '      hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so\\n', '      much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of\\n', '      hours that evening.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 11\\n', '\\n', '      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her\\n', '      sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into\\n', '      the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with\\n', '      many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them\\n', '      so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the\\n', '      gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were\\n', '      considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,\\n', '      relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance\\n', '      with spirit.\\n', '\\n', '      But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first\\n', '      object; Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,\\n', '      and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many\\n', '      steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite\\n', '      congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he\\n', '      was “very glad;” but diffuseness and warmth remained for\\n', '      Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first\\n', '      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer\\n', '      from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the\\n', '      other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the\\n', '      door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\\n', '      else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with\\n', '      great delight.\\n', '\\n', '      When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\\n', '      card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence\\n', '      that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found\\n', '      even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one\\n', '      intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the\\n', '      subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to\\n', '      do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.\\n', '      Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,\\n', '      principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings,\\n', '      joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\\n', '      Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching\\n', '      Mr. Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own;\\n', '      and she was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at\\n', '      his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he\\n', '      merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite\\n', '      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which\\n', '      she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she\\n', '      gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it is to spend an\\n', '      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment\\n', '      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\\n', '      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I\\n', '      have not an excellent library.”\\n', '\\n', '      No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her\\n', '      book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some\\n', '      amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss\\n', '      Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:\\n', '\\n', '      “By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a\\n', '      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on\\n', '      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much\\n', '      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be\\n', '      rather a punishment than a pleasure.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\\n', '      chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a\\n', '      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup\\n', '      enough, I shall send round my cards.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they\\n', '      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something\\n', '      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It\\n', '      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of\\n', '      dancing were made the order of the day.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would\\n', '      not be near so much like a ball.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and\\n', '      walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked\\n', '      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly\\n', '      studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one\\n', '      effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and\\n', '      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing\\n', '      after sitting so long in one attitude.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss\\n', '      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr.\\n', '      Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention\\n', '      in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously\\n', '      closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but\\n', '      he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives\\n', '      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with\\n', '      either of which motives his joining them would interfere. “What\\n', '      could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\\n', '      meaning?”—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand\\n', '      him?\\n', '\\n', '      “Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be\\n', '      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to\\n', '      ask nothing about it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy\\n', '      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation\\n', '      of his two motives.\\n', '\\n', '      “I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he,\\n', '      as soon as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this\\n', '      method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s\\n', '      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you\\n', '      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage\\n', '      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and\\n', '      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the\\n', '      fire.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\\n', '      abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said\\n', '      Elizabeth. “We can all plague and punish one another. Tease\\n', '      him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to\\n', '      be done.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy\\n', '      has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and\\n', '      presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to\\n', '      laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by\\n', '      attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug\\n', '      himself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\\n', '      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it\\n', '      would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I\\n', '      dearly love a laugh.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.\\n', '      The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their\\n', '      actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object\\n', '      in life is a joke.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly,” replied Elizabeth—“there are such people, but I hope\\n', '      I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and\\n', '      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_\\n', '      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,\\n', '      I suppose, are precisely what you are without.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the\\n', '      study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a\\n', '      strong understanding to ridicule.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Such as vanity and pride.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a\\n', '      real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good\\n', '      regulation.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\\n', '\\n', '      “Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss\\n', '      Bingley; “and pray what is the result?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He\\n', '      owns it himself without disguise.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults\\n', '      enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I\\n', '      dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little\\n', '      yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I\\n', '      cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,\\n', '      nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed\\n', '      about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be\\n', '      called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable\\n', '      resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your\\n', '      fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some\\n', '      particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best\\n', '      education can overcome.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to\\n', '      misunderstand them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\\n', '      conversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not\\n', '      mind my waking Mr. Hurst?”\\n', '\\n', '      Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was\\n', '      opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not\\n', '      sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too\\n', '      much attention.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 12\\n', '\\n', '      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth\\n', '      wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage\\n', '      might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till\\n', '      the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane’s week,\\n', '      could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her\\n', '      answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to\\n', '      Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the\\n', '      carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that\\n', '      if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she\\n', '      could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,\\n', '      Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it\\n', '      would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered\\n', '      as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow\\n', '      Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled\\n', '      that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning\\n', '      should be mentioned, and the request made.\\n', '\\n', '      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough\\n', '      was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day\\n', '      to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.\\n', '      Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for\\n', '      her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her\\n', '      affection for the other.\\n', '\\n', '      The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to\\n', '      go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it\\n', '      would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but\\n', '      Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.\\n', '\\n', '      To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at\\n', '      Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and\\n', '      Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to\\n', '      himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no\\n', '      sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could\\n', '      elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible\\n', '      that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the\\n', '      last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.\\n', '      Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through\\n', '      the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by\\n', '      themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to\\n', '      his book, and would not even look at her.\\n', '\\n', '      On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to\\n', '      almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth\\n', '      increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for\\n', '      Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the\\n', '      pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn\\n', '      or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook\\n', '      hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in\\n', '      the liveliest of spirits.\\n', '\\n', '      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to\\n', '      give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold\\n', '      again. But their father, though very laconic in his expressions\\n', '      of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their\\n', '      importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when\\n', '      they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and\\n', '      almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and\\n', '      human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new\\n', '      observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and\\n', '      Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been\\n', '      done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding\\n', '      Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their\\n', '      uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been\\n', '      hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 13\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at\\n', '      breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner\\n', '      to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family\\n', '      party.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am\\n', '      sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope\\n', '      _my_ dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often\\n', '      sees such at home.”\\n', '\\n', '      “The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is\\n', '      Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad\\n', '      to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a\\n', '      bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I\\n', '      must speak to Hill this moment.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom\\n', '      I never saw in the whole course of my life.”\\n', '\\n', '      This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of\\n', '      being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at\\n', '      once.\\n', '\\n', '      After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus\\n', '      explained:\\n', '\\n', '      “About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight\\n', '      ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and\\n', '      requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,\\n', '      who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon\\n', '      as he pleases.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that\\n', '      mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is\\n', '      the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be\\n', '      entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had\\n', '      been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other\\n', '      about it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an\\n', '      entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a\\n', '      subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and\\n', '      she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an\\n', '      estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man\\n', '      whom nobody cared anything about.\\n', '\\n', '      “It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and\\n', '      nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting\\n', '      Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps\\n', '      be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very\\n', '      impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.\\n', '      I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling\\n', '      with you, as his father did before him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on\\n', '      that head, as you will hear.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.\\n', '\\n', '      “Dear Sir,—\\n', '      “The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late\\n', '      honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have\\n', '      had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal\\n', '      the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,\\n', '      fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to\\n', '      be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him\\n', '      to be at variance.—‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’—My mind, however, is now\\n', '      made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,\\n', '      I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage\\n', '      of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir\\n', '      Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to\\n', '      the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest\\n', '      endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\n', '      ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies\\n', '      which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,\\n', '      moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing\\n', '      of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on\\n', '      these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are\\n', '      highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in\\n', '      the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your\\n', '      side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I\\n', '      cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring\\n', '      your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as\\n', '      well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible\\n', '      amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to\\n', '      receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of\\n', '      waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four\\n', '      o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the\\n', '      Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any\\n', '      inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my\\n', '      occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other\\n', '      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear\\n', '      sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your\\n', '      well-wisher and friend,\\n', '\\n', '      “WILLIAM COLLINS”\\n', '\\n', '      “At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making\\n', '      gentleman,” said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He\\n', '      seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my\\n', '      word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,\\n', '      especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him\\n', '      come to us again.”\\n', '\\n', '      “There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however,\\n', '      and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the\\n', '      person to discourage him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can\\n', '      mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is\\n', '      certainly to his credit.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for\\n', '      Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying,\\n', '      and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.\\n', '\\n', '      “He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him\\n', '      out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can\\n', '      he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot\\n', '      suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man,\\n', '      sir?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him\\n', '      quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and\\n', '      self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am\\n', '      impatient to see him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem\\n', '      defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly\\n', '      new, yet I think it is well expressed.”\\n', '\\n', '      To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in\\n', '      any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their\\n', '      cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks\\n', '      since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any\\n', '      other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done\\n', '      away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with\\n', '      a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\n', '      politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;\\n', '      but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed\\n', '      neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent\\n', '      himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of\\n', '      five-and-twenty. His air was grave and stately, and his manners\\n', '      were very formal. He had not been long seated before he\\n', '      complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;\\n', '      said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance\\n', '      fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\\n', '      doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.\\n', '      This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers;\\n', '      but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most\\n', '      readily.\\n', '\\n', '      “You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it\\n', '      may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are\\n', '      settled so oddly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,\\n', '      you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for\\n', '      such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no\\n', '      knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,\\n', '      and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of\\n', '      appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young\\n', '      ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not\\n', '      say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—”\\n', '\\n', '      He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled\\n', '      on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s\\n', '      admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,\\n', '      were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything\\n', '      would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying\\n', '      supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The\\n', '      dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know\\n', '      to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was\\n', '      owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him\\n', '      with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good\\n', '      cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He\\n', '      begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she\\n', '      declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to\\n', '      apologise for about a quarter of an hour.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 14\\n', '\\n', '      During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the\\n', '      servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some\\n', '      conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in\\n', '      which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very\\n', '      fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention\\n', '      to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very\\n', '      remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins\\n', '      was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than\\n', '      usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he\\n', '      protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour\\n', '      in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had\\n', '      himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously\\n', '      pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already\\n', '      had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him\\n', '      twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday\\n', '      before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady\\n', '      Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had\\n', '      never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken\\n', '      to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the\\n', '      smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\n', '      neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a\\n', '      week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to\\n', '      advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with\\n', '      discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble\\n', '      parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations\\n', '      he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some\\n', '      herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      “and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that\\n', '      great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near\\n', '      you, sir?”\\n', '\\n', '      “The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by\\n', '      a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”\\n', '\\n', '      “She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\n', '      extensive property.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off\\n', '      than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she\\n', '      handsome?”\\n', '\\n', '      “She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself\\n', '      says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far\\n', '      superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in\\n', '      her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.\\n', '      She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has\\n', '      prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments\\n', '      which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by\\n', '      the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides\\n', '      with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to\\n', '      drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the\\n', '      ladies at court.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in\\n', '      town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has\\n', '      deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her\\n', '      ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I\\n', '      am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate\\n', '      compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more\\n', '      than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter\\n', '      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,\\n', '      instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These\\n', '      are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it\\n', '      is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound\\n', '      to pay.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for\\n', '      you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May\\n', '      I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse\\n', '      of the moment, or are the result of previous study?”\\n', '\\n', '      “They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though\\n', '      I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such\\n', '      little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary\\n', '      occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as\\n', '      possible.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as\\n', '      absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest\\n', '      enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute\\n', '      composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at\\n', '      Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.\\n', '\\n', '      By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet\\n', '      was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when\\n', '      tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.\\n', '      Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on\\n', '      beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a\\n', '      circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon,\\n', '      protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and\\n', '      Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\\n', '      deliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened\\n', '      the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity,\\n', '      read three pages, she interrupted him with:\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\n', '      Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt\\n', '      told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow\\n', '      to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from\\n', '      town.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but\\n', '      Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\n', '\\n', '      “I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by\\n', '      books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their\\n', '      benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be\\n', '      nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no\\n', '      longer importune my young cousin.”\\n', '\\n', '      Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist\\n', '      at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that\\n', '      he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling\\n', '      amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly\\n', '      for Lydia’s interruption, and promised that it should not occur\\n', '      again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after\\n', '      assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and\\n', '      should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself\\n', '      at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 15\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature\\n', '      had been but little assisted by education or society; the\\n', '      greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of\\n', '      an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one\\n', '      of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms,\\n', '      without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in\\n', '      which his father had brought him up had given him originally\\n', '      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted\\n', '      by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the\\n', '      consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A\\n', '      fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh\\n', '      when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he\\n', '      felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his\\n', '      patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his\\n', '      authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him\\n', '      altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance\\n', '      and humility.\\n', '\\n', '      Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended\\n', '      to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn\\n', '      family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the\\n', '      daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were\\n', '      represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of\\n', '      atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it\\n', '      an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and\\n', '      excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.\\n', '\\n', '      His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face\\n', '      confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of\\n', '      what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was\\n', '      his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an\\n', '      alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his\\n', '      parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his\\n', '      hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn,\\n', '      produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\n', '      encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.\\n', '      “As to her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to\\n', '      say—she could not positively answer—but she did not _know_ of any\\n', '      prepossession; her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention—she\\n', '      felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon\\n', '      engaged.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was\\n', '      soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.\\n', '      Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded\\n', '      her of course.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might\\n', '      soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not\\n', '      bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.\\n', '\\n', '      Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every\\n', '      sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to\\n', '      attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious\\n', '      to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither\\n', '      Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would\\n', '      continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the\\n', '      collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little\\n', '      cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings\\n', '      discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been\\n', '      always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as\\n', '      he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other\\n', '      room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his\\n', '      civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to\\n', '      join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact\\n', '      much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely\\n', '      pleased to close his large book, and go.\\n', '\\n', '      In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\n', '      cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The\\n', '      attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by\\n', '      _him_. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in\\n', '      quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet\\n', '      indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall\\n', '      them.\\n', '\\n', '      But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,\\n', '      whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike\\n', '      appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the\\n', '      way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return\\n', '      from London Lydia came to enquire, and he bowed as they passed.\\n', '      All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he\\n', '      could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find\\n', '      out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting\\n', '      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained\\n', '      the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached\\n', '      the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\n', '      permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned\\n', '      with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had\\n', '      accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it\\n', '      should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him\\n', '      completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he\\n', '      had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good\\n', '      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed\\n', '      up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness\\n', '      at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole\\n', '      party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\\n', '      when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley\\n', '      were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of\\n', '      the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\n', '      began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,\\n', '      and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on\\n', '      his way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her. Mr. Darcy\\n', '      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to\\n', '      fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by\\n', '      the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the\\n', '      countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all\\n', '      astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\\n', '      one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few\\n', '      moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\n', '      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was\\n', '      impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\\n', '\\n', '      In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have\\n', '      noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the\\n', '      door of Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite\\n', '      of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and\\n', '      even in spite of Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window\\n', '      and loudly seconding the invitation.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two\\n', '      eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and\\n', '      she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return\\n', '      home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she\\n', '      should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see\\n', '      Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they\\n', '      were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the\\n', '      Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\\n', '      towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received\\n', '      him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much\\n', '      more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\n', '      acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering\\n', '      himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the\\n', '      young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was\\n', '      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her\\n', '      contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by\\n', '      exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she\\n', '      could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny\\n', '      had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\n', '      lieutenant’s commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him\\n', '      the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and\\n', '      had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have\\n', '      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now\\n', '      except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the\\n', '      stranger, were become “stupid, disagreeable fellows.” Some of\\n', '      them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their\\n', '      aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give\\n', '      him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come\\n', '      in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested\\n', '      that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\n', '      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect\\n', '      of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual\\n', '      good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the\\n', '      room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were\\n', '      perfectly needless.\\n', '\\n', '      As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen\\n', '      pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have\\n', '      defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,\\n', '      she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by\\n', '      admiring Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested\\n', '      that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a\\n', '      more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the\\n', '      utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her\\n', '      invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her\\n', '      before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his\\n', '      connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much\\n', '      attention in the whole course of his life.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 16\\n', '\\n', '      As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with\\n', '      their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most\\n', '      steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at\\n', '      a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of\\n', '      hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had\\n', '      accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.\\n', '\\n', '      When this information was given, and they had all taken their\\n', '      seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire,\\n', '      and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the\\n', '      apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself\\n', '      in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison\\n', '      that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.\\n', '      Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its\\n', '      proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one\\n', '      of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the\\n', '      chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\n', '      the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a\\n', '      comparison with the housekeeper’s room.\\n', '\\n', '      In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her\\n', '      mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble\\n', '      abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily\\n', '      employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.\\n', '      Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his\\n', '      consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving\\n', '      to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To\\n', '      the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had\\n', '      nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their\\n', '      own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\\n', '      interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,\\n', '      however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked\\n', '      into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing\\n', '      him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree\\n', '      of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in\\n', '      general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of\\n', '      them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond\\n', '      them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were\\n', '      superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing\\n', '      port wine, who followed them into the room.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female\\n', '      eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he\\n', '      finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he\\n', '      immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its\\n', '      being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest,\\n', '      most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill\\n', '      of the speaker.\\n', '\\n', '      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and\\n', '      the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to\\n', '      the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at\\n', '      intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her\\n', '      watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.\\n', '      When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of\\n', '      obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.\\n', '\\n', '      “I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be\\n', '      glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—” Mrs.\\n', '      Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for\\n', '      his reason.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\n', '      received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first\\n', '      there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she\\n', '      was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond\\n', '      of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the\\n', '      game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to\\n', '      have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common\\n', '      demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk\\n', '      to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what\\n', '      she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told—the\\n', '      history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\\n', '      mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\n', '      relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He enquired how\\n', '      far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her\\n', '      answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been\\n', '      staying there.\\n', '\\n', '      “About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the\\n', '      subject drop, added, “He is a man of very large property in\\n', '      Derbyshire, I understand.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A\\n', '      clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a\\n', '      person more capable of giving you certain information on that\\n', '      head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a\\n', '      particular manner from my infancy.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not but look surprised.\\n', '\\n', '      “You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,\\n', '      after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our\\n', '      meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\\n', '\\n', '      “As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I\\n', '      have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him\\n', '      very disagreeable.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his\\n', '      being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I\\n', '      have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is\\n', '      impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But I believe your opinion\\n', '      of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not\\n', '      express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your\\n', '      own family.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house\\n', '      in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked\\n', '      in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will\\n', '      not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short\\n', '      interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated\\n', '      beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often\\n', '      happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or\\n', '      frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as\\n', '      he chooses to be seen.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\n', '      ill-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.\\n', '\\n', '      “I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking,\\n', '      “whether he is likely to be in this country much longer.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away\\n', '      when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the\\n', '      ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! no—it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If\\n', '      _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on\\n', '      friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I\\n', '      have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim\\n', '      before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most\\n', '      painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet,\\n', '      the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,\\n', '      and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company\\n', '      with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\n', '      thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\\n', '      scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\n', '      everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and\\n', '      disgracing the memory of his father.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and\\n', '      listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented\\n', '      further enquiry.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\n', '      neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all\\n', '      that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but\\n', '      very intelligible gallantry.\\n', '\\n', '      “It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he\\n', '      added, “which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I\\n', '      knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend\\n', '      Denny tempted me further by his account of their present\\n', '      quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent\\n', '      acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is\\n', '      necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits\\n', '      will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A\\n', '      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances\\n', '      have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my\\n', '      profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this\\n', '      time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it\\n', '      pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of\\n', '      the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively\\n', '      attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to\\n', '      provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the\\n', '      living fell, it was given elsewhere.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How\\n', '      could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal\\n', '      redress?”\\n', '\\n', '      “There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest\\n', '      as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have\\n', '      doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to\\n', '      treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert\\n', '      that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,\\n', '      imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the\\n', '      living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to\\n', '      hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less\\n', '      certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\n', '      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,\\n', '      and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\n', '      freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are\\n', '      very different sort of men, and that he hates me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Some time or other he _will_ be—but it shall not be by _me_.\\n', '      Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him\\n', '      handsomer than ever as he expressed them.\\n', '\\n', '      “But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?\\n', '      What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?”\\n', '\\n', '      “A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot\\n', '      but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy\\n', '      liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his\\n', '      father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very\\n', '      early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of\\n', '      competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was\\n', '      often given me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never\\n', '      liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed\\n', '      him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not\\n', '      suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such\\n', '      injustice, such inhumanity as this.”\\n', '\\n', '      After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\\n', '      remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the\\n', '      implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving\\n', '      temper. His disposition must be dreadful.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_\\n', '      can hardly be just to him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,\\n', '      “To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite\\n', '      of his father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like\\n', '      _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being\\n', '      amiable”—but she contented herself with, “and one, too, who had\\n', '      probably been his companion from childhood, connected together,\\n', '      as I think you said, in the closest manner!”\\n', '\\n', '      “We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the\\n', '      greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the\\n', '      same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same\\n', '      parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which\\n', '      your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he\\n', '      gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted\\n', '      all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most\\n', '      highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential\\n', '      friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the\\n', '      greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence, and\\n', '      when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\n', '      voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he\\n', '      felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his\\n', '      affection to myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that\\n', '      the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If\\n', '      from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to\\n', '      be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions\\n', '      may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.\\n', '      It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other\\n', '      feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour\\n', '      to me there were stronger impulses even than pride.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give\\n', '      his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants,\\n', '      and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride—for he is\\n', '      very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear\\n', '      to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,\\n', '      or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful\\n', '      motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_\\n', '      brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian\\n', '      of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the\\n', '      most attentive and best of brothers.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”\\n', '\\n', '      He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me\\n', '      pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her\\n', '      brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and\\n', '      pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and\\n', '      hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a\\n', '      handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,\\n', '      highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her home has been\\n', '      London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\n', '      education.”\\n', '\\n', '      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth\\n', '      could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\n', '\\n', '      “I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.\\n', '      Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,\\n', '      truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they\\n', '      suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not at all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know\\n', '      what Mr. Darcy is.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does\\n', '      not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he\\n', '      thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals\\n', '      in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the\\n', '      less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich\\n', '      he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and\\n', '      perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure.”\\n', '\\n', '      The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered\\n', '      round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between\\n', '      his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to\\n', '      his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;\\n', '      he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express\\n', '      her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity\\n', '      that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the\\n', '      money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make\\n', '      herself uneasy.\\n', '\\n', '      “I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down\\n', '      to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,\\n', '      and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five\\n', '      shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not\\n', '      say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am\\n', '      removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.\\n', '      Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice\\n', '      whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the\\n', '      family of de Bourgh.\\n', '\\n', '      “Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given\\n', '      him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced\\n', '      to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne\\n', '      Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present\\n', '      Mr. Darcy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s\\n', '      connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\\n', '      yesterday.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,\\n', '      and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two\\n', '      estates.”\\n', '\\n', '      This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor\\n', '      Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and\\n', '      useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself,\\n', '      if he were already self-destined for another.\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine\\n', '      and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related\\n', '      of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that\\n', '      in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant,\\n', '      conceited woman.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I\\n', '      have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I\\n', '      never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and\\n', '      insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and\\n', '      clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities\\n', '      from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner,\\n', '      and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chooses that\\n', '      everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the\\n', '      first class.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of\\n', '      it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction\\n', '      till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies\\n', '      their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions. There could be no\\n', '      conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but\\n', '      his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was\\n', '      said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went\\n', '      away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of\\n', '      Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but\\n', '      there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went,\\n', '      for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked\\n', '      incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\n', '      fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of\\n', '      Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least\\n', '      regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,\\n', '      and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to\\n', '      say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at\\n', '      Longbourn House.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 17\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between\\n', '      Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and\\n', '      concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so\\n', '      unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her\\n', '      nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable\\n', '      appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such\\n', '      unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and\\n', '      nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them\\n', '      both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account\\n', '      of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.\\n', '\\n', '      “They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some\\n', '      way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people\\n', '      have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,\\n', '      impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which\\n', '      may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to\\n', '      say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been\\n', '      concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be\\n', '      obliged to think ill of somebody.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\n', '      opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful\\n', '      light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite\\n', '      in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide\\n', '      for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had\\n', '      any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most\\n', '      intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on,\\n', '      than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as\\n', '      he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without\\n', '      ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,\\n', '      there was truth in his looks.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what\\n', '      to think.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”\\n', '\\n', '      But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr.\\n', '      Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer\\n', '      when the affair became public.\\n', '\\n', '      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\n', '      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom\\n', '      they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give\\n', '      their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at\\n', '      Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two\\n', '      ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it\\n', '      an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been\\n', '      doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the\\n', '      family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much\\n', '      as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\n', '      the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats\\n', '      with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and\\n', '      hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.\\n', '\\n', '      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to\\n', '      every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as\\n', '      given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly\\n', '      flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,\\n', '      instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy\\n', '      evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of\\n', '      their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a\\n', '      great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of\\n', '      everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness\\n', '      anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single\\n', '      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like\\n', '      Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he\\n', '      was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a\\n', '      ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her\\n', '      family that she had no disinclination for it.\\n', '\\n', '      “While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is\\n', '      enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening\\n', '      engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself\\n', '      one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement\\n', '      as desirable for everybody.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though\\n', '      she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could\\n', '      not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s\\n', '      invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to\\n', '      join in the evening’s amusement; and she was rather surprised to\\n', '      find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and\\n', '      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,\\n', '      or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a\\n', '      ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to\\n', '      respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far\\n', '      from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be\\n', '      honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of\\n', '      the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,\\n', '      Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference\\n', '      which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,\\n', '      and not to any disrespect for her.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully\\n', '      proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and\\n', '      to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse\\n', '      timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness\\n', '      and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.\\n', '      Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.\\n', '      She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea\\n', '      it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that\\n', '      _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being\\n', '      mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\n', '      quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible\\n', '      visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed\\n', '      his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent\\n', '      attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more\\n', '      astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms,\\n', '      it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the\\n', '      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_.\\n', '      Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well\\n', '      aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any\\n', '      reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did,\\n', '      it was useless to quarrel about him.\\n', '\\n', '      If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk\\n', '      of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable\\n', '      state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the\\n', '      day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented\\n', '      their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news\\n', '      could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were\\n', '      got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her\\n', '      patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of\\n', '      her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance\\n', '      on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\n', '      Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 18\\n', '\\n', '      Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and\\n', '      looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats\\n', '      there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred\\n', '      to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any\\n', '      of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed\\n', '      her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in\\n', '      the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained\\n', '      unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might\\n', '      be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the\\n', '      dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s\\n', '      pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though\\n', '      this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence\\n', '      was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly\\n', '      applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to\\n', '      town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;\\n', '      adding, with a significant smile, “I do not imagine his business\\n', '      would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to\\n', '      avoid a certain gentleman here.”\\n', '\\n', '      This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was\\n', '      caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not\\n', '      less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise\\n', '      had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former\\n', '      was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could\\n', '      hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries\\n', '      which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,\\n', '      forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was\\n', '      resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned\\n', '      away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly\\n', '      surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality\\n', '      provoked her.\\n', '\\n', '      But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every\\n', '      prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not\\n', '      dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to\\n', '      Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon\\n', '      able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her\\n', '      cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first\\n', '      two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were\\n', '      dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\n', '      apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without\\n', '      being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a\\n', '      disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment\\n', '      of her release from him was ecstasy.\\n', '\\n', '      She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of\\n', '      talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.\\n', '      When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and\\n', '      was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly\\n', '      addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his\\n', '      application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she\\n', '      accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left\\n', '      to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to\\n', '      console her:\\n', '\\n', '      “I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!\\n', '      To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not\\n', '      wish me such an evil.”\\n', '\\n', '      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to\\n', '      claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a\\n', '      whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham\\n', '      to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his\\n', '      consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the\\n', '      set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being\\n', '      allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her\\n', '      neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They\\n', '      stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\n', '      imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,\\n', '      and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying\\n', '      that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige\\n', '      him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He\\n', '      replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she\\n', '      addressed him a second time with:—“It is _your_ turn to say\\n', '      something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_\\n', '      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the\\n', '      number of couples.”\\n', '\\n', '      He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say\\n', '      should be said.\\n', '\\n', '      “Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by\\n', '      I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public\\n', '      ones. But _now_ we may be silent.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd\\n', '      to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the\\n', '      advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as\\n', '      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do\\n', '      you imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\\n', '      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\\n', '      taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\n', '      something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\n', '      posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am\\n', '      sure,” said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend\\n', '      to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I must not decide on my own performance.”\\n', '\\n', '      He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone\\n', '      down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not\\n', '      very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and,\\n', '      unable to resist the temptation, added, “When you met us there\\n', '      the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance.”\\n', '\\n', '      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread\\n', '      his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though\\n', '      blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length\\n', '      Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is\\n', '      blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_\\n', '      friends—whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is\\n', '      less certain.”\\n', '\\n', '      “He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied\\n', '      Elizabeth with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to\\n', '      suffer from all his life.”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the\\n', '      subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to\\n', '      them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the\\n', '      room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of\\n', '      superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his\\n', '      partner.\\n', '\\n', '      “I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\\n', '      superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong\\n', '      to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair\\n', '      partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this\\n', '      pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable\\n', '      event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall\\n', '      take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to\\n', '      Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank\\n', '      me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young\\n', '      lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”\\n', '\\n', '      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but\\n', '      Sir William’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him\\n', '      forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious\\n', '      expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.\\n', '      Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner,\\n', '      and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we\\n', '      were talking of.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not\\n', '      have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for\\n', '      themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without\\n', '      success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What think you of books?” said he, smiling.\\n', '\\n', '      “Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the\\n', '      same feelings.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at\\n', '      least be no want of subject. We may compare our different\\n', '      opinions.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full\\n', '      of something else.”\\n', '\\n', '      “The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes—does it?” said\\n', '      he, with a look of doubt.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for\\n', '      her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon\\n', '      afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember\\n', '      hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,\\n', '      that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very\\n', '      cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am,” said he, with a firm voice.\\n', '\\n', '      “And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope not.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their\\n', '      opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first.”\\n', '\\n', '      “May I ask to what these questions tend?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she,\\n', '      endeavouring to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it\\n', '      out.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And what is your success?”\\n', '\\n', '      She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such\\n', '      different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may\\n', '      vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,\\n', '      that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,\\n', '      as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no\\n', '      credit on either.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\n', '      opportunity.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly\\n', '      replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and\\n', '      parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to\\n', '      an equal degree, for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably\\n', '      powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and\\n', '      directed all his anger against another.\\n', '\\n', '      They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her,\\n', '      and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\n', '\\n', '      “So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George\\n', '      Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking\\n', '      me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite\\n', '      forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was\\n', '      the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me\\n', '      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit\\n', '      confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him\\n', '      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always\\n', '      been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\n', '      Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the\\n', '      particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the\\n', '      least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham\\n', '      mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not\\n', '      well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\\n', '      was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the\\n', '      way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,\\n', '      indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\\n', '      Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but\\n', '      really, considering his descent, one could not expect much\\n', '      better.”\\n', '\\n', '      “His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the\\n', '      same,” said Elizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him\\n', '      of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward,\\n', '      and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a\\n', '      sneer. “Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much\\n', '      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as\\n', '      this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the\\n', '      malice of Mr. Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had\\n', '      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane\\n', '      met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such\\n', '      happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was\\n', '      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth\\n', '      instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\n', '      Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else,\\n', '      gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for\\n', '      happiness.\\n', '\\n', '      “I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling\\n', '      than her sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But\\n', '      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any\\n', '      third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\n', '      satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\n', '      his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which\\n', '      have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the\\n', '      good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is\\n', '      perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less\\n', '      attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to\\n', '      say by his account as well as his sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no\\n', '      means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very\\n', '      imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\\n', '      satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\\n', '\\n', '      “He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has\\n', '      heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it\\n', '      was left to him _conditionally_ only.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth\\n', '      warmly; “but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances\\n', '      only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I\\n', '      dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the\\n', '      story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall\\n', '      venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.”\\n', '\\n', '      She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,\\n', '      and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth\\n', '      listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which\\n', '      Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley’s regard, and said all in her\\n', '      power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by\\n', '      Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose\\n', '      enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had\\n', '      scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told\\n', '      her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\n', '      to make a most important discovery.\\n', '\\n', '      “I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there\\n', '      is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to\\n', '      overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who\\n', '      does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de\\n', '      Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these\\n', '      sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,\\n', '      perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I\\n', '      am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay\\n', '      my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will\\n', '      excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the\\n', '      connection must plead my apology.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it\\n', '      earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will\\n', '      be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well\\n', '      yesterday se’nnight.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring\\n', '      him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without\\n', '      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment\\n', '      to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should\\n', '      be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong\\n', '      to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the\\n', '      acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air\\n', '      of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking,\\n', '      replied thus:\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world\\n', '      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of\\n', '      your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a\\n', '      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst\\n', '      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me\\n', '      leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in\\n', '      point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided\\n', '      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time\\n', '      maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of\\n', '      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I\\n', '      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\\n', '      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\n', '      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted\\n', '      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a\\n', '      young lady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to\\n', '      attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly\\n', '      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very\\n', '      evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and\\n', '      though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it\\n', '      all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\\n', '      “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see\\n', '      him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\\n', '      unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him\\n', '      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.\\n', '      Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and\\n', '      Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length\\n', '      of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a\\n', '      slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to\\n', '      Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied\\n', '      with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the\\n', '      attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid\\n', '      me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady\\n', '      Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a\\n', '      favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon\\n', '      the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\\n', '\\n', '      As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she\\n', '      turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr.\\n', '      Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her\\n', '      observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as\\n', '      Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the\\n', '      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she\\n', '      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to\\n', '      like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly saw\\n', '      were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near\\n', '      her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,\\n', '      therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\n', '      placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to\\n', '      find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)\\n', '      freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane\\n', '      would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating\\n', '      subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while\\n', '      enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a\\n', '      charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from\\n', '      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was\\n', '      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,\\n', '      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\n', '      she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her\\n', '      younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them\\n', '      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at\\n', '      her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to\\n', '      the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go\\n', '      into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this\\n', '      circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it\\n', '      is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to\\n', '      find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\\n', '      concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be\\n', '      equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing\\n', '      there was no chance of it.\\n', '\\n', '      In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her\\n', '      mother’s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a\\n', '      less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she\\n', '      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,\\n', '      who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being\\n', '      nonsensical.\\n', '\\n', '      “What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I\\n', '      am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged\\n', '      to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”\\n', '\\n', '      “For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be\\n', '      for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to\\n', '      his friend by so doing!”\\n', '\\n', '      Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her\\n', '      mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.\\n', '      Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She\\n', '      could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though\\n', '      every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was\\n', '      not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his\\n', '      attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face\\n', '      changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\n', '      steady gravity.\\n', '\\n', '      At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady\\n', '      Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights\\n', '      which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts\\n', '      of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not\\n', '      long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,\\n', '      singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing\\n', '      Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the\\n', '      company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she\\n', '      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;\\n', '      Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting\\n', '      was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s eyes\\n', '      were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched\\n', '      her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which\\n', '      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,\\n', '      amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she\\n', '      might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of\\n', '      half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means\\n', '      fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner\\n', '      affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see\\n', '      how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.\\n', '      She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of\\n', '      derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\n', '      imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\\n', '      interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the\\n', '      hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,\\n', '      “That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long\\n', '      enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;\\n', '      and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech,\\n', '      was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were\\n', '      now applied to.\\n', '\\n', '      “If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to\\n', '      sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the\\n', '      company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent\\n', '      diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a\\n', '      clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be\\n', '      justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there\\n', '      are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a\\n', '      parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an\\n', '      agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\n', '      offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the\\n', '      time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and\\n', '      the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be\\n', '      excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not\\n', '      think it of light importance that he should have attentive and\\n', '      conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those\\n', '      to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty;\\n', '      nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of\\n', '      testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\n', '      family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech,\\n', '      which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.\\n', '      Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\\n', '      Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins\\n', '      for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to\\n', '      Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young\\n', '      man.\\n', '\\n', '      To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement\\n', '      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it\\n', '      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more\\n', '      spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley\\n', '      and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his\\n', '      notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much\\n', '      distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his\\n', '      two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an\\n', '      opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she\\n', '      could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,\\n', '      or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\\n', '\\n', '      The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was\\n', '      teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her\\n', '      side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him\\n', '      again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did\\n', '      she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to\\n', '      introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that\\n', '      as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief\\n', '      object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and\\n', '      that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\n', '      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She\\n', '      owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often\\n', '      joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s\\n', '      conversation to herself.\\n', '\\n', '      She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further\\n', '      notice; though often standing within a very short distance of\\n', '      her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She\\n', '      felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr.\\n', '      Wickham, and rejoiced in it.\\n', '\\n', '      The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,\\n', '      and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their\\n', '      carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,\\n', '      which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by\\n', '      some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened\\n', '      their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently\\n', '      impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every\\n', '      attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\n', '      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by\\n', '      the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.\\n', '      Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,\\n', '      and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their\\n', '      behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,\\n', '      in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane\\n', '      were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and\\n', '      talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\n', '      silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was\\n', '      too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation\\n', '      of “Lord, how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\\n', '\\n', '      When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most\\n', '      pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at\\n', '      Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to\\n', '      assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner\\n', '      with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal\\n', '      invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily\\n', '      engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her,\\n', '      after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the\\n', '      next day for a short time.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under\\n', '      the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary\\n', '      preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,\\n', '      she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in\\n', '      the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter\\n', '      married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and\\n', '      with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the\\n', '      least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the\\n', '      match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was\\n', '      eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 19\\n', '\\n', '      The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made\\n', '      his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of\\n', '      time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following\\n', '      Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it\\n', '      distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a\\n', '      very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed\\n', '      a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after\\n', '      breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\n', '\\n', '      “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter\\n', '      Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience\\n', '      with her in the course of this morning?”\\n', '\\n', '      Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise,\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am\\n', '      sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no\\n', '      objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.” And, gathering her\\n', '      work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:\\n', '\\n', '      “Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must\\n', '      excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not\\n', '      hear. I am going away myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.”\\n', '      And upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed\\n', '      looks, about to escape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your\\n', '      staying and hearing Mr. Collins.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment’s\\n', '      consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to\\n', '      get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down\\n', '      again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings\\n', '      which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet\\n', '      and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins\\n', '      began.\\n', '\\n', '      “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far\\n', '      from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other\\n', '      perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had\\n', '      there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to\\n', '      assure you, that I have your respected mother’s permission for\\n', '      this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,\\n', '      however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my\\n', '      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as\\n', '      I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my\\n', '      future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\n', '      subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons\\n', '      for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with\\n', '      the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\\n', '\\n', '      The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run\\n', '      away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that\\n', '      she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to\\n', '      stop him further, and he continued:\\n', '\\n', '      “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right\\n', '      thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to\\n', '      set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am\\n', '      convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and\\n', '      thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it\\n', '      is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble\\n', '      lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she\\n', '      condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this\\n', '      subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left\\n', '      Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\n', '      arranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr.\\n', '      Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose\\n', '      properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_,\\n', '      let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,\\n', '      but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.\\n', '      Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and\\n', '      I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair\\n', '      cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady\\n', '      Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my\\n', '      power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can\\n', '      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable\\n', '      to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\\n', '      which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\\n', '      intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my\\n', '      views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own\\n', '      neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable\\n', '      young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit\\n', '      this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,\\n', '      however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself\\n', '      without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\n', '      the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the\\n', '      melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already\\n', '      said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my\\n', '      fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your\\n', '      esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the\\n', '      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To\\n', '      fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of\\n', '      that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could\\n', '      not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four\\n', '      per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s\\n', '      decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\\n', '      therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure\\n', '      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when\\n', '      we are married.”\\n', '\\n', '      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\\n', '\\n', '      “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made\\n', '      no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my\\n', '      thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible\\n', '      of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to\\n', '      do otherwise than to decline them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave\\n', '      of the hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the\\n', '      addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he\\n', '      first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is\\n', '      repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no\\n', '      means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to\\n', '      lead you to the altar ere long.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather\\n', '      extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am\\n', '      not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)\\n', '      who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of\\n', '      being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.\\n', '      You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the\\n', '      last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your\\n', '      friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find\\n', '      me in every respect ill qualified for the situation.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr.\\n', '      Collins very gravely—“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship\\n', '      would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I\\n', '      have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very\\n', '      highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable\\n', '      qualification.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\\n', '      must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\n', '      of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and\\n', '      by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being\\n', '      otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the\\n', '      delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take\\n', '      possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any\\n', '      self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as\\n', '      finally settled.” And rising as she thus spoke, she would have\\n', '      quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:\\n', '\\n', '      “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the\\n', '      subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than\\n', '      you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of\\n', '      cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established\\n', '      custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and\\n', '      perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as\\n', '      would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female\\n', '      character.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you\\n', '      puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to\\n', '      you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my\\n', '      refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that\\n', '      your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My\\n', '      reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to\\n', '      me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the\\n', '      establishment I can offer would be any other than highly\\n', '      desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family\\n', '      of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances\\n', '      highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\n', '      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\\n', '      by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be\\n', '      made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all\\n', '      likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable\\n', '      qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not\\n', '      serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it\\n', '      to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the\\n', '      usual practice of elegant females.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to\\n', '      that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable\\n', '      man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed\\n', '      sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done\\n', '      me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely\\n', '      impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak\\n', '      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending\\n', '      to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth\\n', '      from her heart.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\\n', '      gallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the\\n', '      express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals\\n', '      will not fail of being acceptable.”\\n', '\\n', '      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would\\n', '      make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;\\n', '      determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals\\n', '      as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose\\n', '      negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and\\n', '      whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the\\n', '      affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 20\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\n', '      successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the\\n', '      vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw\\n', '      Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the\\n', '      staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated\\n', '      both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their\\n', '      nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these\\n', '      felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate\\n', '      the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he\\n', '      trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal\\n', '      which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\n', '      from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her\\n', '      character.\\n', '\\n', '      This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have\\n', '      been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to\\n', '      encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared\\n', '      not believe it, and could not help saying so.\\n', '\\n', '      “But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall\\n', '      be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She\\n', '      is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own\\n', '      interest but I will _make_ her know it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but\\n', '      if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she\\n', '      would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my\\n', '      situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage\\n', '      state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit,\\n', '      perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me,\\n', '      because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not\\n', '      contribute much to my felicity.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.\\n', '      “Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything\\n', '      else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go\\n', '      directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with\\n', '      her, I am sure.”\\n', '\\n', '      She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to\\n', '      her husband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr.\\n', '      Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You\\n', '      must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\\n', '      not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his\\n', '      mind and not have _her_.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and\\n', '      fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the\\n', '      least altered by her communication.\\n', '\\n', '      “I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she\\n', '      had finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr.\\n', '      Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have\\n', '      Lizzy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless\\n', '      business.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon\\n', '      her marrying him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\n', '      library.\\n', '\\n', '      “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have\\n', '      sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.\\n', '      Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth\\n', '      replied that it was. “Very well—and this offer of marriage you\\n', '      have refused?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have, sir.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon\\n', '      your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, or I will never see her again.”\\n', '\\n', '      “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day\\n', '      you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will\\n', '      never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will\\n', '      never see you again if you _do_.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a\\n', '      beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her\\n', '      husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively\\n', '      disappointed.\\n', '\\n', '      “What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised\\n', '      me to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to\\n', '      request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my\\n', '      understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.\\n', '      I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be.”\\n', '\\n', '      Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband,\\n', '      did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again\\n', '      and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to\\n', '      secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible\\n', '      mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with\\n', '      real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to\\n', '      her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination\\n', '      never did.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had\\n', '      passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what\\n', '      motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was\\n', '      hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite\\n', '      imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother’s\\n', '      reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\\n', '\\n', '      While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to\\n', '      spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia,\\n', '      who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are\\n', '      come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened\\n', '      this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she\\n', '      will not have him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by\\n', '      Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they\\n', '      entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she\\n', '      likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her\\n', '      compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to\\n', '      comply with the wishes of all her family. “Pray do, my dear Miss\\n', '      Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone, “for nobody is on my\\n', '      side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels\\n', '      for my poor nerves.”\\n', '\\n', '      Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and\\n', '      Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as\\n', '      unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were\\n', '      at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss\\n', '      Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer\\n', '      of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and\\n', '      I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father\\n', '      is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I\\n', '      have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,\\n', '      you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will\\n', '      find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to\\n', '      undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in\\n', '      talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous\\n', '      complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can\\n', '      tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not\\n', '      complain are never pitied.”\\n', '\\n', '      Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\n', '      any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase\\n', '      the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption\\n', '      from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who\\n', '      entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on\\n', '      perceiving whom, she said to the girls, “Now, I do insist upon\\n', '      it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.\\n', '      Collins have a little conversation together.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty\\n', '      followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she\\n', '      could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.\\n', '      Collins, whose enquiries after herself and all her family were\\n', '      very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself\\n', '      with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a\\n', '      doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: “Oh!\\n', '      Mr. Collins!”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this\\n', '      point. Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice\\n', '      that marked his displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your\\n', '      daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;\\n', '      the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I\\n', '      have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps\\n', '      not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had\\n', '      my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often\\n', '      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the\\n', '      blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\n', '      estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any\\n', '      disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my\\n', '      pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid\\n', '      yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to\\n', '      interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be\\n', '      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your\\n', '      daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to\\n', '      error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My\\n', '      object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with\\n', '      due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my\\n', '      _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to\\n', '      apologise.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 21\\n', '\\n', '      The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end,\\n', '      and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings\\n', '      necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish\\n', '      allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_\\n', '      feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or\\n', '      dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner\\n', '      and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the\\n', '      assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself\\n', '      were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\n', '      civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all,\\n', '      and especially to her friend.\\n', '\\n', '      The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or\\n', '      ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry\\n', '      pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his\\n', '      visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.\\n', '      He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant\\n', '      to stay.\\n', '\\n', '      After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr.\\n', '      Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the\\n', '      Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and\\n', '      attended them to their aunt’s where his regret and vexation, and\\n', '      the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,\\n', '      however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his\\n', '      absence _had_ been self-imposed.\\n', '\\n', '      “I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not\\n', '      meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with\\n', '      him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,\\n', '      and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a\\n', '      full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they\\n', '      civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer\\n', '      walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he\\n', '      particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double\\n', '      advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and\\n', '      it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her\\n', '      father and mother.\\n', '\\n', '      Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;\\n', '      it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of\\n', '      elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\\n', '      fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance\\n', '      change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some\\n', '      particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting\\n', '      the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the\\n', '      general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the\\n', '      subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\n', '      sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from\\n', '      Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained\\n', '      their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:\\n', '\\n', '      “This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me\\n', '      a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,\\n', '      and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming\\n', '      back again. You shall hear what she says.”\\n', '\\n', '      She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the\\n', '      information of their having just resolved to follow their brother\\n', '      to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor\\n', '      Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:\\n', '      “I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in\\n', '      Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we\\n', '      will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\n', '      delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\n', '      lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\\n', '      unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.” To these\\n', '      highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the\\n', '      insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their\\n', '      removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it\\n', '      was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would\\n', '      prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their\\n', '      society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in\\n', '      the enjoyment of his.\\n', '\\n', '      “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should\\n', '      not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.\\n', '      But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which\\n', '      Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware,\\n', '      and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends\\n', '      will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr.\\n', '      Bingley will not be detained in London by them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\n', '      Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”\\n', '\\n', '      “When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business\\n', '      which took him to London might be concluded in three or four\\n', '      days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time\\n', '      convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry\\n', '      to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither,\\n', '      that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a\\n', '      comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for\\n', '      the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,\\n', '      had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I\\n', '      despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\n', '      abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and\\n', '      that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling\\n', '      the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more\\n', '      this winter.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he\\n', '      _should_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own\\n', '      master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage\\n', '      which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the\\n', '      truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really\\n', '      do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance,\\n', '      and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and\\n', '      myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from\\n', '      the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I\\n', '      do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on\\n', '      this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding\\n', '      them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My\\n', '      brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent\\n', '      opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\\n', '      relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a\\n', '      sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call\\n', '      Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all\\n', '      these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to\\n', '      prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of\\n', '      an event which will secure the happiness of so many?”\\n', '\\n', '      “What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane\\n', '      as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not\\n', '      expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to\\n', '      be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s\\n', '      indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings\\n', '      for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can\\n', '      there be any other opinion on the subject?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear\\n', '      it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Most willingly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her\\n', '      brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.\\n', '      She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries\\n', '      to persuade you that he does not care about you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane shook her head.\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen\\n', '      you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,\\n', '      cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as\\n', '      much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her\\n', '      wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or\\n', '      grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss\\n', '      Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been\\n', '      _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a\\n', '      second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare\\n', '      say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\\n', '      my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss\\n', '      Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is\\n', '      in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he\\n', '      took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to\\n', '      persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very\\n', '      much in love with her friend.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\\n', '      representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know\\n', '      the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully\\n', '      deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that\\n', '      she is deceiving herself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,\\n', '      since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be\\n', '      deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and\\n', '      must fret no longer.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\n', '      accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to\\n', '      marry elsewhere?”\\n', '\\n', '      “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon\\n', '      mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his\\n', '      two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his\\n', '      wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know\\n', '      that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their\\n', '      disapprobation, I could not hesitate.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot\\n', '      consider your situation with much compassion.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\n', '      required. A thousand things may arise in six months!”\\n', '\\n', '      The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the\\n', '      utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of\\n', '      Caroline’s interested wishes, and she could not for a moment\\n', '      suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,\\n', '      could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.\\n', '\\n', '      She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she\\n', '      felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its\\n', '      happy effect. Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she was\\n', '      gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection\\n', '      sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to\\n', '      Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\\n', '\\n', '      They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of\\n', '      the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s\\n', '      conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great\\n', '      deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that\\n', '      the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting\\n', '      so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some\\n', '      length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon\\n', '      down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of\\n', '      all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been\\n', '      invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\n', '      full courses.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 22\\n', '\\n', '      The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again\\n', '      during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen\\n', '      to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.\\n', '      “It keeps him in good humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged\\n', '      to you than I can express.” Charlotte assured her friend of her\\n', '      satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for\\n', '      the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but\\n', '      Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any\\n', '      conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\n', '      from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them\\n', '      towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances\\n', '      were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would\\n', '      have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave\\n', '      Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the\\n', '      fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape\\n', '      out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,\\n', '      and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was\\n', '      anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction\\n', '      that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture\\n', '      his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till\\n', '      its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\n', '      secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably\\n', '      encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure\\n', '      of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering\\n', '      kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked\\n', '      towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally\\n', '      in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love\\n', '      and eloquence awaited her there.\\n', '\\n', '      In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\\n', '      everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;\\n', '      and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name\\n', '      the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such\\n', '      a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no\\n', '      inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with\\n', '      which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any\\n', '      charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss\\n', '      Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested\\n', '      desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment\\n', '      were gained.\\n', '\\n', '      Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their\\n', '      consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.\\n', '      Collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for\\n', '      their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his\\n', '      prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas\\n', '      began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter\\n', '      had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was\\n', '      likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion,\\n', '      that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\n', '      Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and\\n', '      his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole\\n', '      family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The\\n', '      younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner\\n', '      than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\\n', '      from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.\\n', '      Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her\\n', '      point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in\\n', '      general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither\\n', '      sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his\\n', '      attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her\\n', '      husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,\\n', '      marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision\\n', '      for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however\\n', '      uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\n', '      preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained;\\n', '      and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\\n', '      handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable\\n', '      circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to\\n', '      Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any\\n', '      other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame\\n', '      her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings\\n', '      must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her\\n', '      the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when\\n', '      he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\n', '      passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of\\n', '      course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without\\n', '      difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst\\n', '      forth in such very direct questions on his return as required\\n', '      some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising\\n', '      great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous\\n', '      love.\\n', '\\n', '      As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any\\n', '      of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when\\n', '      the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great\\n', '      politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see\\n', '      him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him\\n', '      to visit them.\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\\n', '      gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\n', '      you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon\\n', '      as possible.”\\n', '\\n', '      They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means\\n', '      wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:\\n', '\\n', '      “But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here,\\n', '      my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the\\n', '      risk of offending your patroness.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to\\n', '      you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not\\n', '      taking so material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather\\n', '      than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by\\n', '      your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly\\n', '      probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall\\n', '      take no offence.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\n', '      affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily\\n', '      receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other\\n', '      mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my\\n', '      fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render\\n', '      it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health\\n', '      and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth.”\\n', '\\n', '      With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them\\n', '      equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet\\n', '      wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his\\n', '      addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been\\n', '      prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher\\n', '      than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections\\n', '      which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as\\n', '      herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve\\n', '      himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\n', '      agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of\\n', '      this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,\\n', '      and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of\\n', '      the day before.\\n', '\\n', '      The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with\\n', '      her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or\\n', '      two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far\\n', '      from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her\\n', '      astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first\\n', '      the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:\\n', '\\n', '      “Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!”\\n', '\\n', '      The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling\\n', '      her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so\\n', '      direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected,\\n', '      she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:\\n', '\\n', '      “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it\\n', '      incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s\\n', '      good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with\\n', '      you?”\\n', '\\n', '      But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong\\n', '      effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that\\n', '      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her,\\n', '      and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.\\n', '\\n', '      “I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be\\n', '      surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was\\n', '      wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it\\n', '      over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am\\n', '      not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable\\n', '      home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and\\n', '      situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness\\n', '      with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the\\n', '      marriage state.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward\\n', '      pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not\\n', '      stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what\\n', '      she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all\\n', '      reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness\\n', '      of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days\\n', '      was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had\\n', '      always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly\\n', '      like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that,\\n', '      when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\n', '      feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins\\n', '      was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend\\n', '      disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the\\n', '      distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to\\n', '      be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 23\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on\\n', '      what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to\\n', '      mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his\\n', '      daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many\\n', '      compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of\\n', '      a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an\\n', '      audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be\\n', '      entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,\\n', '      boisterously exclaimed:\\n', '\\n', '      “Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not\\n', '      you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”\\n', '\\n', '      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\n', '      without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding\\n', '      carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be\\n', '      positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all\\n', '      their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so\\n', '      unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his\\n', '      account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte\\n', '      herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her\\n', '      mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to\\n', '      Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by\\n', '      making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be\\n', '      expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,\\n', '      and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal\\n', '      while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than\\n', '      her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she\\n', '      persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she\\n', '      was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she\\n', '      trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,\\n', '      that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were\\n', '      plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real\\n', '      cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been\\n', '      barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she\\n', '      principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\\n', '      console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out\\n', '      her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth\\n', '      without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak\\n', '      to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months\\n', '      were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,\\n', '      and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most\\n', '      agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that\\n', '      Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably\\n', '      sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his\\n', '      daughter!\\n', '\\n', '      Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she\\n', '      said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for\\n', '      their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it\\n', '      as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,\\n', '      for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no\\n', '      other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to\\n', '      retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well\\n', '      married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to\\n', '      say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and\\n', '      ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness\\n', '      away.\\n', '\\n', '      Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept\\n', '      them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded\\n', '      that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.\\n', '      Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard\\n', '      to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her\\n', '      opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew\\n', '      daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and\\n', '      nothing more was heard of his return.\\n', '\\n', '      Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was\\n', '      counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.\\n', '      The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on\\n', '      Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the\\n', '      solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth’s abode in the family\\n', '      might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that\\n', '      head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous\\n', '      expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of\\n', '      their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it\\n', '      was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been\\n', '      so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at\\n', '      Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday\\n', '      fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his\\n', '      marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible,\\n', '      which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his\\n', '      amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the\\n', '      happiest of men.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\n', '      pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much\\n', '      disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange\\n', '      that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it\\n', '      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated\\n', '      having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent,\\n', '      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were\\n', '      the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the\\n', '      greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.\\n', '\\n', '      Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day\\n', '      after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him\\n', '      than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming\\n', '      no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly\\n', '      incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as\\n', '      a most scandalous falsehood.\\n', '\\n', '      Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but\\n', '      that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.\\n', '      Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s\\n', '      happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she\\n', '      could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of\\n', '      his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend,\\n', '      assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of\\n', '      London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his\\n', '      attachment.\\n', '\\n', '      As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course,\\n', '      more painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was\\n', '      desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,\\n', '      therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such\\n', '      delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which\\n', '      she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his\\n', '      arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come\\n', '      back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane’s\\n', '      steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\n', '      tranquillity.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\n', '      reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been\\n', '      on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need\\n', '      much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of\\n', '      love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The\\n', '      chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he\\n', '      sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology\\n', '      for his absence before the family went to bed.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention\\n', '      of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of\\n', '      ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it\\n', '      talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her\\n', '      successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous\\n', '      abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded\\n', '      her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she\\n', '      spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were\\n', '      talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\n', '      and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were\\n', '      dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that\\n', '      Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_\\n', '      should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take\\n', '      her place in it!”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope\\n', '      for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the\\n', '      survivor.”\\n', '\\n', '      This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,\\n', '      instead of making any answer, she went on as before.\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If\\n', '      it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What should not you mind?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should not mind anything at all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\n', '      insensibility.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the\\n', '      entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an\\n', '      estate from one’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for\\n', '      the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than\\n', '      anybody else?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 24\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very\\n', '      first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled\\n', '      in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret\\n', '      at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in\\n', '      Hertfordshire before he left the country.\\n', '\\n', '      Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the\\n', '      rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed\\n', '      affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss\\n', '      Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions\\n', '      were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their\\n', '      increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment\\n', '      of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She\\n', '      wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate\\n', '      of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\n', '      the latter with regard to new furniture.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all\\n', '      this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided\\n', '      between concern for her sister, and resentment against all\\n', '      others. To Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to\\n', '      Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane,\\n', '      she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had\\n', '      always been disposed to like him, she could not think without\\n', '      anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that\\n', '      want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his\\n', '      designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\n', '      to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness,\\n', '      however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to\\n', '      sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her\\n', '      sister’s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible\\n', '      himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be\\n', '      long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing\\n', '      else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or\\n', '      were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether he had been\\n', '      aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\n', '      observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him\\n', '      must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s\\n', '      situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.\\n', '\\n', '      A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her\\n', '      feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them\\n', '      together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield\\n', '      and its master, she could not help saying:\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can\\n', '      have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual\\n', '      reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long.\\n', '      He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but\\n', '      said nothing.\\n', '\\n', '      “You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have\\n', '      no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\n', '      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or\\n', '      fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not\\n', '      _that_ pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to\\n', '      get the better.”\\n', '\\n', '      With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort\\n', '      immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on\\n', '      my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your\\n', '      sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know\\n', '      what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or\\n', '      loved you as you deserve.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw\\n', '      back the praise on her sister’s warm affection.\\n', '\\n', '      “Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all\\n', '      the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.\\n', '      _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself\\n', '      against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my\\n', '      encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need\\n', '      not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of\\n', '      whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I\\n', '      dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the\\n', '      inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little\\n', '      dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\n', '      sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not\\n', '      mention; the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable!\\n', '      In every view it is unaccountable!”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They\\n', '      will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for\\n', '      difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s\\n', '      respectability, and Charlotte’s steady, prudent character.\\n', '      Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune,\\n', '      it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for\\n', '      everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like regard and\\n', '      esteem for our cousin.”\\n', '\\n', '      “To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no\\n', '      one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I\\n', '      persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only\\n', '      think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My\\n', '      dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,\\n', '      silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as\\n', '      well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper\\n', '      way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte\\n', '      Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the\\n', '      meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\n', '      yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility\\n', '      of danger security for happiness.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,”\\n', '      replied Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing\\n', '      them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something\\n', '      else. You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you,\\n', '      but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that\\n', '      person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must\\n', '      not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must\\n', '      not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and\\n', '      circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that\\n', '      deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And men take care that they should.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have\\n', '      no idea of there being so much design in the world as some\\n', '      persons imagine.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to\\n', '      design,” said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to\\n', '      make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.\\n', '      Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings,\\n', '      and want of resolution, will do the business.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And do you impute it to either of those?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by\\n', '      saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you\\n', '      can.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They\\n', '      can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no\\n', '      other woman can secure it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides\\n', '      his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and\\n', '      consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the\\n', '      importance of money, great connections, and pride.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied\\n', '      Jane; “but this may be from better feelings than you are\\n', '      supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known\\n', '      me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their\\n', '      own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their\\n', '      brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,\\n', '      unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed\\n', '      him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so,\\n', '      they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make\\n', '      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do\\n', '      not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\\n', '      mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison\\n', '      of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let\\n', '      me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be\\n', '      understood.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.\\n', '      Bingley’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning\\n', '      no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did\\n', '      not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever\\n', '      considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to\\n', '      convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his\\n', '      attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and\\n', '      transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but\\n', '      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,\\n', '      she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best\\n', '      comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he\\n', '      one day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate\\n', '      her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little\\n', '      in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives\\n', '      her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn\\n', '      to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is\\n', '      your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all\\n', '      the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a\\n', '      pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We\\n', '      must not all expect Jane’s good fortune.”\\n', '\\n', '      “True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that\\n', '      whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate\\n', '      mother who will make the most of it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the\\n', '      gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of\\n', '      the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other\\n', '      recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The\\n', '      whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr.\\n', '      Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly\\n', '      acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to\\n', '      know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had\\n', '      known anything of the matter.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might\\n', '      be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the\\n', '      society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always\\n', '      pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but\\n', '      by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 25\\n', '\\n', '      After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of\\n', '      felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by\\n', '      the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might\\n', '      be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of\\n', '      his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his\\n', '      return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to\\n', '      make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at\\n', '      Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair\\n', '      cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father\\n', '      another letter of thanks.\\n', '\\n', '      On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of\\n', '      receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend\\n', '      the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,\\n', '      gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by\\n', '      nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had\\n', '      difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within\\n', '      view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and\\n', '      agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant\\n', '      woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.\\n', '      Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a\\n', '      particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in\\n', '      town.\\n', '\\n', '      The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to\\n', '      distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When\\n', '      this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her\\n', '      turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and\\n', '      much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she\\n', '      last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of\\n', '      marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got\\n', '      Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard\\n', '      to think that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this\\n', '      time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an\\n', '      offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of\\n', '      it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I\\n', '      have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as\\n', '      ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are\\n', '      all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so\\n', '      it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in\\n', '      my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves\\n', '      before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is\\n', '      the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you\\n', '      tell us, of long sleeves.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given\\n', '      before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with\\n', '      her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her\\n', '      nieces, turned the conversation.\\n', '\\n', '      When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the\\n', '      subject. “It seems likely to have been a desirable match for\\n', '      Jane,” said she. “I am sorry it went off. But these things happen\\n', '      so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so\\n', '      easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when\\n', '      accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort\\n', '      of inconsistencies are very frequent.”\\n', '\\n', '      “An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it\\n', '      will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not\\n', '      often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a\\n', '      young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom\\n', '      he was violently in love with only a few days before.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so\\n', '      doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is\\n', '      as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s\\n', '      acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent\\n', '      was_ Mr. Bingley’s love?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\\n', '      inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every\\n', '      time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own\\n', '      ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to\\n', '      dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an\\n', '      answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility\\n', '      the very essence of love?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.\\n', '      Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she\\n', '      may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to\\n', '      _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.\\n', '      But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us?\\n', '      Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief\\n', '      from home may be as useful as anything.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt\\n', '      persuaded of her sister’s ready acquiescence.\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard\\n', '      to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a\\n', '      part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you\\n', '      well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that\\n', '      they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of\\n', '      his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on\\n', '      Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think\\n', '      of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as\\n', '      Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month’s ablution\\n', '      enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter\\n', '      it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does\\n', '      not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to\\n', '      help calling.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”\\n', '\\n', '      But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to\\n', '      place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of\\n', '      Bingley’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude\\n', '      on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did\\n', '      not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes\\n', '      she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated,\\n', '      and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the\\n', '      more natural influence of Jane’s attractions.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the\\n', '      Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than\\n', '      as she hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her\\n', '      brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without\\n', '      any danger of seeing him.\\n', '\\n', '      The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the\\n', '      Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day\\n', '      without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for\\n', '      the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not\\n', '      once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for\\n', '      home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which\\n', '      officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm\\n', '      commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing\\n', '      them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their\\n', '      preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little\\n', '      uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject\\n', '      before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the\\n', '      imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.\\n', '\\n', '      To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,\\n', '      unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years\\n', '      ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in\\n', '      that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had,\\n', '      therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had\\n', '      been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet\\n', '      in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former\\n', '      friends than she had been in the way of procuring.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by\\n', '      character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible\\n', '      subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley\\n', '      with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in\\n', '      bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late\\n', '      possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being made\\n', '      acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him, she\\n', '      tried to remember some of that gentleman’s reputed disposition\\n', '      when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at\\n', '      last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy\\n', '      formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 26\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly\\n', '      given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her\\n', '      alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went\\n', '      on:\\n', '\\n', '      “You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely\\n', '      because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not\\n', '      afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your\\n', '      guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an\\n', '      affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.\\n', '      I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting\\n', '      young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should\\n', '      think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let\\n', '      your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect\\n', '      you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\\n', '      good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\\n', '      myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me,\\n', '      if I can prevent it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love\\n', '      with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all\\n', '      comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes\\n', '      really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should\\n', '      not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!\\n', '      My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I\\n', '      should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial\\n', '      to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to\\n', '      be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every\\n', '      day that where there is affection, young people are seldom\\n', '      withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into\\n', '      engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than\\n', '      so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even\\n', '      to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise\\n', '      you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry\\n', '      to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with\\n', '      him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so\\n', '      very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of\\n', '      inviting him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:\\n', '      “very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do\\n', '      not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your\\n', '      account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You\\n', '      know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company\\n', '      for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do\\n', '      what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.”\\n', '\\n', '      Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked\\n', '      her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful\\n', '      instance of advice being given on such a point, without being\\n', '      resented.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been\\n', '      quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode\\n', '      with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at\\n', '      length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even\\n', '      repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she “_wished_\\n', '      they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on\\n', '      Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose\\n', '      to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and\\n', '      reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,\\n', '      accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs\\n', '      together, Charlotte said:\\n', '\\n', '      “I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_That_ you certainly shall.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”\\n', '\\n', '      “We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,\\n', '      therefore, to come to Hunsford.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in\\n', '      the visit.\\n', '\\n', '      “My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte,\\n', '      “and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,\\n', '      you will be as welcome as either of them.”\\n', '\\n', '      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent\\n', '      from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to\\n', '      hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her\\n', '      friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as\\n', '      it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was\\n', '      impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling\\n', '      that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined\\n', '      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what\\n', '      had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters were\\n', '      received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be\\n', '      curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she\\n', '      would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce\\n', '      herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt\\n', '      that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she\\n', '      might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with\\n', '      comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The\\n', '      house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her\\n', '      taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and\\n', '      obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings\\n', '      rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait\\n', '      for her own visit there to know the rest.\\n', '\\n', '      Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce\\n', '      their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth\\n', '      hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.\\n', '\\n', '      Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as\\n', '      impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without\\n', '      either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it,\\n', '      however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from\\n', '      Longbourn had by some accident been lost.\\n', '\\n', '      “My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of\\n', '      the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in\\n', '      Grosvenor Street.”\\n', '\\n', '      She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss\\n', '      Bingley. “I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words,\\n', '      “but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving\\n', '      her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my\\n', '      last letter had never reached her. I enquired after their\\n', '      brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr.\\n', '      Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy\\n', '      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not\\n', '      long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I\\n', '      shall see them soon here.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that\\n', '      accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in\\n', '      town.\\n', '\\n', '      Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She\\n', '      endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but\\n', '      she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After\\n', '      waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing\\n', '      every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last\\n', '      appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the\\n', '      alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\\n', '      longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\\n', '      will prove what she felt.\\n', '\\n', '      “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\\n', '      her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to\\n', '      have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But,\\n', '      my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not\\n', '      think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her\\n', '      behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I\\n', '      do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate\\n', '      with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am\\n', '      sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit\\n', '      till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the\\n', '      meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no\\n', '      pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\\n', '      calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and\\n', '      was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went\\n', '      away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no\\n', '      longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very\\n', '      wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every\\n', '      advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because\\n', '      she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am\\n', '      very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need\\n', '      not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to\\n', '      be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account\\n', '      for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his\\n', '      sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural\\n', '      and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such\\n', '      fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have\\n', '      met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from\\n', '      something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner\\n', '      of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is\\n', '      really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were\\n', '      not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say\\n', '      that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I\\n', '      will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of\\n', '      what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable\\n', '      kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\\n', '      soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to\\n', '      Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any\\n', '      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that\\n', '      you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.\\n', '      Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you\\n', '      will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc.”\\n', '\\n', '      This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as\\n', '      she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister\\n', '      at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely\\n', '      over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.\\n', '      His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for\\n', '      him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped\\n', '      he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s\\n', '      account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown\\n', '      away.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise\\n', '      concerning that gentleman, and required information; and\\n', '      Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to\\n', '      her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided,\\n', '      his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.\\n', '      Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it\\n', '      and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but\\n', '      slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing\\n', '      that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted\\n', '      it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\\n', '      remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering\\n', '      himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in\\n', '      this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his\\n', '      wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more\\n', '      natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few\\n', '      struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and\\n', '      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him\\n', '      happy.\\n', '\\n', '      All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating\\n', '      the circumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear\\n', '      aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really\\n', '      experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present\\n', '      detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my\\n', '      feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even\\n', '      impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at\\n', '      all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good\\n', '      sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness\\n', '      has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more\\n', '      interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in\\n', '      love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative\\n', '      insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.\\n', '      Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.\\n', '      They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the\\n', '      mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something\\n', '      to live on as well as the plain.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 27\\n', '\\n', '      With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and\\n', '      otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,\\n', '      sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass\\n', '      away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at\\n', '      first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she\\n', '      soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned\\n', '      to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater\\n', '      certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte\\n', '      again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty\\n', '      in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\\n', '      uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little\\n', '      change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would\\n', '      moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew\\n', '      near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,\\n', '      however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to\\n', '      Charlotte’s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and\\n', '      his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in\\n', '      London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan\\n', '      could be.\\n', '\\n', '      The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss\\n', '      her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her\\n', '      going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to\\n', '      answer her letter.\\n', '\\n', '      The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly\\n', '      friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not\\n', '      make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and\\n', '      to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the\\n', '      first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu,\\n', '      wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to\\n', '      expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of\\n', '      her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a\\n', '      solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to\\n', '      him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced\\n', '      that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of\\n', '      the amiable and pleasing.\\n', '\\n', '      Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her\\n', '      think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter\\n', '      Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had\\n', '      nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to\\n', '      with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth\\n', '      loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long. He\\n', '      could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and\\n', '      knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his\\n', '      information.\\n', '\\n', '      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so\\n', '      early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching\\n', '      their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to\\n', '      welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was\\n', '      pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs\\n', '      were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their\\n', '      cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the\\n', '      drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a\\n', '      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\\n', '      kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in\\n', '      bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object\\n', '      was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear,\\n', '      in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always\\n', '      struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of\\n', '      dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would\\n', '      not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of\\n', '      Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated\\n', '      conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\\n', '      herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given\\n', '      up the acquaintance.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and\\n', '      complimented her on bearing it so well.\\n', '\\n', '      “But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss\\n', '      King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial\\n', '      affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does\\n', '      discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid\\n', '      of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,\\n', '      because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds,\\n', '      you want to find out that he is mercenary.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall\\n', '      know what to think.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of\\n', '      her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But he paid her not the smallest attention till her\\n', '      grandfather’s death made her mistress of this fortune.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\\n', '      affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be\\n', '      for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was\\n', '      equally poor?”\\n', '\\n', '      “But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions\\n', '      towards her so soon after this event.”\\n', '\\n', '      “A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those\\n', '      elegant decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does\\n', '      not object to it, why should _we_?”\\n', '\\n', '      “_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her\\n', '      being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\\n', '      mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry,\\n', '      you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in\\n', '      Derbyshire.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who\\n', '      live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in\\n', '      Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank\\n', '      Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not\\n', '      one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to\\n', '      recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after\\n', '      all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of\\n', '      disappointment.”\\n', '\\n', '      Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had\\n', '      the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle\\n', '      and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the\\n', '      summer.\\n', '\\n', '      “We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner, “but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”\\n', '\\n', '      No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her\\n', '      acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my\\n', '      dear, dear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what\\n', '      felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to\\n', '      disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and\\n', '      mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when\\n', '      we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without\\n', '      being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know\\n', '      where we have gone—we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,\\n', '      mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our\\n', '      imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular\\n', '      scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let\\n', '      _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the\\n', '      generality of travellers.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 28\\n', '\\n', '      Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\\n', '      Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she\\n', '      had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her\\n', '      health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant\\n', '      source of delight.\\n', '\\n', '      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye\\n', '      was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to\\n', '      bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary\\n', '      on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she\\n', '      had heard of its inhabitants.\\n', '\\n', '      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to\\n', '      the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the\\n', '      laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins\\n', '      and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at\\n', '      the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,\\n', '      amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they\\n', '      were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.\\n', '      Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and\\n', '      Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found\\n', '      herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her\\n', '      cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal\\n', '      civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\\n', '      minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all\\n', '      her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing\\n', '      out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as\\n', '      soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time,\\n', '      with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually\\n', '      repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not\\n', '      help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the\\n', '      room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself\\n', '      particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had\\n', '      lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and\\n', '      comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of\\n', '      repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she\\n', '      could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\\n', '      Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\\n', '      ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily\\n', '      turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a\\n', '      faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After\\n', '      sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the\\n', '      room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of\\n', '      their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.\\n', '      Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was\\n', '      large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he\\n', '      attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\\n', '      respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of\\n', '      countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of\\n', '      the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.\\n', '      Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and\\n', '      scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked\\n', '      for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left\\n', '      beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every\\n', '      direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most\\n', '      distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\\n', '      the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\\n', '      the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\\n', '      bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was\\n', '      a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\\n', '\\n', '      From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two\\n', '      meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the\\n', '      remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William\\n', '      accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the\\n', '      house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity\\n', '      of showing it without her husband’s help. It was rather small,\\n', '      but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and\\n', '      arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave\\n', '      Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,\\n', '      there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\\n', '      Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must\\n', '      be often forgotten.\\n', '\\n', '      She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the\\n', '      country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when\\n', '      Mr. Collins joining in, observed:\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady\\n', '      Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need\\n', '      not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and\\n', '      condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some\\n', '      portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any\\n', '      hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in\\n', '      every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.\\n', '      Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at\\n', '      Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her\\n', '      ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say,\\n', '      one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,”\\n', '      added Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort\\n', '      of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”\\n', '\\n', '      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\\n', '      and telling again what had already been written; and when it\\n', '      closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to\\n', '      meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand\\n', '      her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her\\n', '      husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She\\n', '      had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor\\n', '      of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.\\n', '      Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A\\n', '      lively imagination soon settled it all.\\n', '\\n', '      About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting\\n', '      ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole\\n', '      house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard\\n', '      somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly\\n', '      after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing\\n', '      place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the\\n', '      dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not\\n', '      tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing\\n', '      more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the\\n', '      lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a\\n', '      low phaeton at the garden gate.\\n', '\\n', '      “And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the\\n', '      pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady\\n', '      Catherine and her daughter.”\\n', '\\n', '      “La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is\\n', '      not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives\\n', '      with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is\\n', '      quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be\\n', '      so thin and small?”\\n', '\\n', '      “She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all\\n', '      this wind. Why does she not come in?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of\\n', '      favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.\\n', '      “She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well.\\n', '      She will make him a very proper wife.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in\\n', '      conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s\\n', '      high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest\\n', '      contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing\\n', '      whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.\\n', '\\n', '      At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,\\n', '      and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw\\n', '      the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good\\n', '      fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the\\n', '      whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 29\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was\\n', '      complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness\\n', '      to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility\\n', '      towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for;\\n', '      and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was\\n', '      such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension, as he knew\\n', '      not how to admire enough.\\n', '\\n', '      “I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all\\n', '      surprised by her ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and\\n', '      spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my\\n', '      knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could\\n', '      have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined\\n', '      that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an\\n', '      invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately\\n', '      after your arrival!”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir\\n', '      William, “from that knowledge of what the manners of the great\\n', '      really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.\\n', '      About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not\\n', '      uncommon.”\\n', '\\n', '      Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but\\n', '      their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing\\n', '      them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,\\n', '      so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly\\n', '      overpower them.\\n', '\\n', '      When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to\\n', '      Elizabeth—\\n', '\\n', '      “Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.\\n', '      Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us\\n', '      which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely\\n', '      to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there\\n', '      is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think\\n', '      the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the\\n', '      distinction of rank preserved.”\\n', '\\n', '      While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their\\n', '      different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady\\n', '      Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.\\n', '      Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of\\n', '      living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to\\n', '      company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings\\n', '      with as much apprehension as her father had done to his\\n', '      presentation at St. James’s.\\n', '\\n', '      As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\\n', '      mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its\\n', '      prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she\\n', '      could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene\\n', '      to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of\\n', '      the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the\\n', '      glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\\n', '\\n', '      When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every\\n', '      moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly\\n', '      calm. Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing\\n', '      of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary\\n', '      talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money\\n', '      or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.\\n', '\\n', '      From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\\n', '      rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,\\n', '      they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room\\n', '      where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were\\n', '      sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive\\n', '      them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that\\n', '      the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a\\n', '      proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he\\n', '      would have thought necessary.\\n', '\\n', '      In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so\\n', '      completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but\\n', '      just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat\\n', '      without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of\\n', '      her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way\\n', '      to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and\\n', '      could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady\\n', '      Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,\\n', '      which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\\n', '      conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to\\n', '      make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not\\n', '      rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken\\n', '      in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and\\n', '      brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the\\n', '      observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to\\n', '      be exactly what he represented.\\n', '\\n', '      When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and\\n', '      deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she\\n', '      turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in\\n', '      Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was\\n', '      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss\\n', '      de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain,\\n', '      were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low\\n', '      voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing\\n', '      remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she\\n', '      said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her\\n', '      eyes.\\n', '\\n', '      After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the\\n', '      windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point\\n', '      out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that\\n', '      it was much better worth looking at in the summer.\\n', '\\n', '      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the\\n', '      servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had\\n', '      promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at\\n', '      the bottom of the table, by her ladyship’s desire, and looked as\\n', '      if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved,\\n', '      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was\\n', '      commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now\\n', '      enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\\n', '      manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But\\n', '      Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,\\n', '      and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the\\n', '      table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much\\n', '      conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an\\n', '      opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de\\n', '      Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady\\n', '      Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.\\n', '      Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss\\n', '      de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\\n', '      she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\\n', '      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\\n', '\\n', '      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\\n', '      be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without\\n', '      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on\\n', '      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not\\n', '      used to have her judgement controverted. She enquired into\\n', '      Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a\\n', '      great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her\\n', '      how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as\\n', '      hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her\\n', '      poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great\\n', '      lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of\\n', '      dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.\\n', '      Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\\n', '      Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she\\n', '      knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very\\n', '      genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times,\\n', '      how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than\\n', '      herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether\\n', '      they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage\\n', '      her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name?\\n', '      Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered\\n', '      them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,\\n', '\\n', '      “Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For\\n', '      your sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise\\n', '      I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It\\n', '      was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you\\n', '      play and sing, Miss Bennet?”\\n', '\\n', '      “A little.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\\n', '      instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try\\n', '      it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\\n', '\\n', '      “One of them does.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The\\n', '      Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income\\n', '      as yours. Do you draw?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, not at all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What, none of you?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not one.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your\\n', '      mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit\\n', '      of masters.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates\\n', '      London.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Has your governess left you?”\\n', '\\n', '      “We never had any governess.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up\\n', '      at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your\\n', '      mother must have been quite a slave to your education.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had\\n', '      not been the case.\\n', '\\n', '      “Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,\\n', '      you must have been neglected.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us\\n', '      as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always\\n', '      encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.\\n', '      Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if\\n', '      I had known your mother, I should have advised her most\\n', '      strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be\\n', '      done in education without steady and regular instruction, and\\n', '      nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many\\n', '      families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am\\n', '      always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of\\n', '      Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;\\n', '      and it was but the other day that I recommended another young\\n', '      person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the\\n', '      family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you\\n', '      of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss\\n', '      Pope a treasure. ‘Lady Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a\\n', '      treasure.’ Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, ma’am, all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the\\n', '      second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!\\n', '      Your younger sisters must be very young?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to\\n', '      be much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very\\n', '      hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share\\n', '      of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the\\n', '      means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a\\n', '      right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back\\n', '      on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to\\n', '      promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very\\n', '      decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\\n', '\\n', '      “With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth,\\n', '      smiling, “your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct\\n', '      answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature\\n', '      who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\\n', '\\n', '      “You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need\\n', '      not conceal your age.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am not one-and-twenty.”\\n', '\\n', '      When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the\\n', '      card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and\\n', '      Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose\\n', '      to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting\\n', '      Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was\\n', '      superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did\\n', '      not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her\\n', '      fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having\\n', '      too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\\n', '      other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the\\n', '      mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of\\n', '      herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her\\n', '      ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and\\n', '      apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not\\n', '      say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble\\n', '      names.\\n', '\\n', '      When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they\\n', '      chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to\\n', '      Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The\\n', '      party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine\\n', '      determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From\\n', '      these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the\\n', '      coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s\\n', '      side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon as\\n', '      they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\\n', '      cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings,\\n', '      which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it\\n', '      really was. But her commendation, though costing her some\\n', '      trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very\\n', '      soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise into his own hands.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 30\\n', '\\n', '      Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was\\n', '      long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most\\n', '      comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and\\n', '      such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William\\n', '      was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out\\n', '      in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away,\\n', '      the whole family returned to their usual employments, and\\n', '      Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her\\n', '      cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between\\n', '      breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the\\n', '      garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window\\n', '      in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which\\n', '      the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather\\n', '      wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for\\n', '      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant\\n', '      aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason\\n', '      for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been\\n', '      much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally\\n', '      lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\\n', '\\n', '      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,\\n', '      and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what\\n', '      carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh\\n', '      drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform\\n', '      them of, though it happened almost every day. She not\\n', '      unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’\\n', '      conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon\\n', '      to get out.\\n', '\\n', '      Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to\\n', '      Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it\\n', '      necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that\\n', '      there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could\\n', '      not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they\\n', '      were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped\\n', '      her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.\\n', '      She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and\\n', '      advised them to do it differently; found fault with the\\n', '      arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in\\n', '      negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it\\n', '      only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of\\n', '      meat were too large for her family.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in\\n', '      the commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active\\n', '      magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were\\n', '      carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers\\n', '      were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she\\n', '      sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,\\n', '      silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.\\n', '\\n', '      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a\\n', '      week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being\\n', '      only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was\\n', '      the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,\\n', '      as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond\\n', '      Mr. Collins’s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and\\n', '      upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were\\n', '      half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the\\n', '      weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great\\n', '      enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\\n', '      frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,\\n', '      was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where\\n', '      there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but\\n', '      herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s\\n', '      curiosity.\\n', '\\n', '      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed\\n', '      away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to\\n', '      bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a\\n', '      circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her\\n', '      arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few\\n', '      weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom\\n', '      she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively\\n', '      new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused\\n', '      in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his\\n', '      behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by\\n', '      Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\\n', '      satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration,\\n', '      and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been\\n', '      frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.\\n', '\\n', '      His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was\\n', '      walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into\\n', '      Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and\\n', '      after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park,\\n', '      hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following\\n', '      morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\\n', '      two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had\\n', '      brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his\\n', '      uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when\\n', '      Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte\\n', '      had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and\\n', '      immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour\\n', '      they might expect, adding:\\n', '\\n', '      “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy\\n', '      would never have come so soon to wait upon me.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the\\n', '      compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,\\n', '      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not\\n', '      handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.\\n', '      Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in\\n', '      Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to\\n', '      Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\\n', '      friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth\\n', '      merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.\\n', '\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the\\n', '      readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very\\n', '      pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight\\n', '      observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some\\n', '      time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his\\n', '      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the\\n', '      health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and\\n', '      after a moment’s pause, added:\\n', '\\n', '      “My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you\\n', '      never happened to see her there?”\\n', '\\n', '      She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to\\n', '      see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed\\n', '      between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little\\n', '      confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to\\n', '      meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the\\n', '      gentlemen soon afterwards went away.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 31\\n', '\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the\\n', '      Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably\\n', '      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some\\n', '      days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for\\n', '      while there were visitors in the house, they could not be\\n', '      necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after\\n', '      the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by such an\\n', '      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to\\n', '      come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very\\n', '      little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\n', '      called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.\\n', '      Darcy they had seen only at church.\\n', '\\n', '      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they\\n', '      joined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship\\n', '      received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by\\n', '      no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she\\n', '      was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them,\\n', '      especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the\\n', '      room.\\n', '\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was\\n', '      a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty\\n', '      friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated\\n', '      himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and\\n', '      Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books\\n', '      and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained\\n', '      in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and\\n', '      flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well\\n', '      as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\\n', '      towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship,\\n', '      after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,\\n', '      for she did not scruple to call out:\\n', '\\n', '      “What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are\\n', '      talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it\\n', '      is.”\\n', '\\n', '      “We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able\\n', '      to avoid a reply.\\n', '\\n', '      “Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my\\n', '      delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are\\n', '      speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,\\n', '      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better\\n', '      natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great\\n', '      proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to\\n', '      apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.\\n', '      How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s\\n', '      proficiency.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady\\n', '      Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to\\n', '      excel if she does not practice a good deal.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such\\n', '      advice. She practises very constantly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next\\n', '      write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any\\n', '      account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is\\n', '      to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet\\n', '      several times, that she will never play really well unless she\\n', '      practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is\\n', '      very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every\\n', '      day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She\\n', '      would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part of the house.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and\\n', '      made no answer.\\n', '\\n', '      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of\\n', '      having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the\\n', '      instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to\\n', '      half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew;\\n', '      till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual\\n', '      deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to\\n', '      command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance.\\n', '      Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient\\n', '      pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:\\n', '\\n', '      “You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state\\n', '      to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play\\n', '      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to\\n', '      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at\\n', '      every attempt to intimidate me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you\\n', '      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming\\n', '      you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough\\n', '      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing\\n', '      opinions which in fact are not your own.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said\\n', '      to Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty\\n', '      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am\\n', '      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose\\n', '      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to\\n', '      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it\\n', '      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my\\n', '      disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very\\n', '      impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\\n', '      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.\\n', '\\n', '      “Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel\\n', '      Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among\\n', '      strangers.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very\\n', '      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire,\\n', '      you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think\\n', '      he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;\\n', '      and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was\\n', '      sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the\\n', '      fact.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the\\n', '      assembly beyond my own party.”\\n', '\\n', '      “True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your\\n', '      orders.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought\\n', '      an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to\\n', '      strangers.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth,\\n', '      still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man\\n', '      of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill\\n', '      qualified to recommend himself to strangers?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying\\n', '      to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said\\n', '      Darcy, “of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.\\n', '      I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested\\n', '      in their concerns, as I often see done.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument\\n', '      in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have\\n', '      not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same\\n', '      expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own\\n', '      fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is\\n', '      not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other\\n', '      woman’s of superior execution.”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have\\n', '      employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege\\n', '      of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us\\n', '      perform to strangers.”\\n', '\\n', '      Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to\\n', '      know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began\\n', '      playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening\\n', '      for a few minutes, said to Darcy:\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more,\\n', '      and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very\\n', '      good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to\\n', '      Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her\\n', '      health allowed her to learn.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his\\n', '      cousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other\\n', '      could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his\\n', '      behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss\\n', '      Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_,\\n', '      had she been his relation.\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance,\\n', '      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.\\n', '      Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,\\n', '      and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument\\n', '      till her ladyship’s carriage was ready to take them all home.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 32\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to\\n', '      Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the\\n', '      village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain\\n', '      signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it\\n', '      not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension\\n', '      was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape\\n', '      all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very\\n', '      great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.\\n', '\\n', '      He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for\\n', '      his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the\\n', '      ladies were to be within.\\n', '\\n', '      They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were\\n', '      made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was\\n', '      absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in\\n', '      this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in\\n', '      Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on\\n', '      the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:\\n', '\\n', '      “How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.\\n', '      Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley\\n', '      to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he\\n', '      went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope,\\n', '      when you left London?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perfectly so, I thank you.”\\n', '\\n', '      She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a\\n', '      short pause added:\\n', '\\n', '      “I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of\\n', '      ever returning to Netherfield again?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may\\n', '      spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many\\n', '      friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements\\n', '      are continually increasing.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better\\n', '      for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely,\\n', '      for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,\\n', '      perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the\\n', '      convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must\\n', '      expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it\\n', '      up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\\n', '      friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to\\n', '      leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.\\n', '\\n', '      He took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very\\n', '      comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to\\n', '      it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\\n', '      kindness on a more grateful object.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a\\n', '      wife.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with\\n', '      one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him,\\n', '      or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent\\n', '      understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her\\n', '      marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems\\n', '      perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is\\n', '      certainly a very good match for her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a\\n', '      distance of her own family and friends.”\\n', '\\n', '      “An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a\\n', '      day’s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should never have considered the distance as one of the\\n', '      _advantages_ of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have\\n', '      said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything\\n', '      beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would\\n', '      appear far.”\\n', '\\n', '      As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she\\n', '      understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\\n', '      Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near\\n', '      her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on\\n', '      many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the\\n', '      expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But\\n', '      that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a\\n', '      comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent\\n', '      journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself\\n', '      _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_\\n', '      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_\\n', '      cannot have been always at Longbourn.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change\\n', '      of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the\\n', '      table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:\\n', '\\n', '      “Are you pleased with Kent?”\\n', '\\n', '      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either\\n', '      side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of\\n', '      Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The\\n', '      _tête-à-tête_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which\\n', '      had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a\\n', '      few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.\\n', '\\n', '      “What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he\\n', '      was gone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he\\n', '      would never have called on us in this familiar way.”\\n', '\\n', '      But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very\\n', '      likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after\\n', '      various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to\\n', '      proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was\\n', '      the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were\\n', '      over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a\\n', '      billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and\\n', '      in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk\\n', '      to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a\\n', '      temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.\\n', '      They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\\n', '      separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by\\n', '      their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam\\n', '      came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which\\n', '      of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded\\n', '      by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his\\n', '      evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George\\n', '      Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less\\n', '      captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she\\n', '      believed he might have the best informed mind.\\n', '\\n', '      But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more\\n', '      difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he\\n', '      frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his\\n', '      lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity\\n', '      rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to\\n', '      himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew\\n', '      not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally\\n', '      laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally\\n', '      different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\\n', '      her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the\\n', '      effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she\\n', '      set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him\\n', '      whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford;\\n', '      but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a\\n', '      great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It\\n', '      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether\\n', '      there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing\\n', '      but absence of mind.\\n', '\\n', '      She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of\\n', '      his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the\\n', '      idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the\\n', '      subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only\\n', '      end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a\\n', '      doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would vanish, if she could\\n', '      suppose him to be in her power.\\n', '\\n', '      In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her\\n', '      marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most\\n', '      pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life\\n', '      was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.\\n', '      Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin\\n', '      could have none at all.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 33\\n', '\\n', '      More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,\\n', '      unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the\\n', '      mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought,\\n', '      and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him\\n', '      at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could\\n', '      occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and\\n', '      even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary\\n', '      penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal\\n', '      enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually\\n', '      thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never\\n', '      said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of\\n', '      talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of\\n', '      their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected\\n', '      questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of\\n', '      solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s\\n', '      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly\\n', '      understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she\\n', '      came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too. His words\\n', '      seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his\\n', '      thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an\\n', '      allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a\\n', '      little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\\n', '      pales opposite the Parsonage.\\n', '\\n', '      She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last\\n', '      letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had\\n', '      not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by\\n', '      Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was\\n', '      meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a\\n', '      smile, she said:\\n', '\\n', '      “I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I\\n', '      generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at\\n', '      the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, I should have turned in a moment.”\\n', '\\n', '      And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the\\n', '      Parsonage together.\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his\\n', '      disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at\\n', '      least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know\\n', '      anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes\\n', '      than Mr. Darcy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel\\n', '      Fitzwilliam. “But so we all do. It is only that he has better\\n', '      means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many\\n', '      others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must\\n', '      be inured to self-denial and dependence.”\\n', '\\n', '      “In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little\\n', '      of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial\\n', '      and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money\\n', '      from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a\\n', '      fancy for?”\\n', '\\n', '      “These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have\\n', '      experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of\\n', '      greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons\\n', '      cannot marry where they like.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very\\n', '      often do.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not\\n', '      many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some\\n', '      attention to money.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at\\n', '      the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And\\n', '      pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless\\n', '      the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask\\n', '      above fifty thousand pounds.”\\n', '\\n', '      He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To\\n', '      interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with\\n', '      what had passed, she soon afterwards said:\\n', '\\n', '      “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the\\n', '      sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not\\n', '      marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,\\n', '      perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is\\n', '      under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he\\n', '      must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of\\n', '      Miss Darcy.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?\\n', '      Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age\\n', '      are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the\\n', '      true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.”\\n', '\\n', '      As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the\\n', '      manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss\\n', '      Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she\\n', '      had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly\\n', '      replied:\\n', '\\n', '      “You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I\\n', '      dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.\\n', '      She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my\\n', '      acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard\\n', '      you say that you know them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike\\n', '      man—he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to\\n', '      Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him\\n', '      in those points where he most wants care. From something that he\\n', '      told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley\\n', '      very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I\\n', '      have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It\\n', '      was all conjecture.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What is it you mean?”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally\\n', '      known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it\\n', '      would be an unpleasant thing.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\\n', '      Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated\\n', '      himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences\\n', '      of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any\\n', '      other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from\\n', '      believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that\\n', '      sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of\\n', '      last summer.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I understood that there were some very strong objections against\\n', '      the lady.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And what arts did he use to separate them?”\\n', '\\n', '      “He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam,\\n', '      smiling. “He only told me what I have now told you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\\n', '      indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her\\n', '      why she was so thoughtful.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\\n', '      cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\\n', '      judge?”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety\\n', '      of his friend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement\\n', '      alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend\\n', '      was to be happy. But,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as\\n', '      we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.\\n', '      It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the\\n', '      case.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is\\n', '      a lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\\n', '\\n', '      This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a\\n', '      picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an\\n', '      answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked\\n', '      on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,\\n', '      shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she\\n', '      could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It\\n', '      was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than\\n', '      those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the\\n', '      world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless\\n', '      influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to\\n', '      separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\\n', '      always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\\n', '      arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead\\n', '      him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of\\n', '      all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had\\n', '      ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most\\n', '      affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say\\n', '      how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.\\n', '\\n', '      “There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably\\n', '      were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and\\n', '      another who was in business in London.\\n', '\\n', '      “To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility\\n', '      of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her\\n', '      understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners\\n', '      captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,\\n', '      who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy\\n', '      himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will\\n', '      probably never reach.” When she thought of her mother, her\\n', '      confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any\\n', '      objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose\\n', '      pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the\\n', '      want of importance in his friend’s connections, than from their\\n', '      want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had\\n', '      been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by\\n', '      the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\\n', '\\n', '      The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on\\n', '      a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,\\n', '      added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her\\n', '      not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to\\n', '      drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did\\n', '      not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband\\n', '      from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his\\n', '      apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather displeased by her\\n', '      staying at home.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 34\\n', '\\n', '      When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate\\n', '      herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her\\n', '      employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had\\n', '      written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual\\n', '      complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any\\n', '      communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost\\n', '      every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which\\n', '      had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding\\n', '      from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly\\n', '      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.\\n', '      Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of\\n', '      uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the\\n', '      first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he had\\n', '      been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister’s\\n', '      sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to\\n', '      Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still\\n', '      greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with\\n', '      Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\\n', '      spirits, by all that affection could do.\\n', '\\n', '      She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering\\n', '      that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had\\n', '      made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as\\n', '      he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.\\n', '\\n', '      While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound\\n', '      of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the\\n', '      idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once\\n', '      before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire\\n', '      particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her\\n', '      spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter\\n', '      amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried\\n', '      manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing\\n', '      his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered\\n', '      him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then\\n', '      getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\\n', '      said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came\\n', '      towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:\\n', '\\n', '      “In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not\\n', '      be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire\\n', '      and love you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared,\\n', '      coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient\\n', '      encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long\\n', '      felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were\\n', '      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was\\n', '      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His\\n', '      sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family\\n', '      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on\\n', '      with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was\\n', '      wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.\\n', '\\n', '      In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be\\n', '      insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and\\n', '      though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at\\n', '      first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to\\n', '      resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in\\n', '      anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with\\n', '      patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\\n', '      representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in\\n', '      spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer;\\n', '      and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her\\n', '      acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see\\n', '      that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of\\n', '      apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real\\n', '      security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,\\n', '      when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:\\n', '\\n', '      “In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\\n', '      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\\n', '      unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation\\n', '      should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now\\n', '      thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion,\\n', '      and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry\\n', '      to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously\\n', '      done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings\\n', '      which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of\\n', '      your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after\\n', '      this explanation.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes\\n', '      fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less\\n', '      resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger,\\n', '      and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He\\n', '      was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not\\n', '      open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The\\n', '      pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, with a\\n', '      voice of forced calmness, he said:\\n', '\\n', '      “And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of\\n', '      expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so\\n', '      little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of\\n', '      small importance.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I might as well enquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a\\n', '      desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that\\n', '      you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even\\n', '      against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,\\n', '      if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I\\n', '      have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been\\n', '      indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that\\n', '      any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been\\n', '      the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\\n', '      beloved sister?”\\n', '\\n', '      As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the\\n', '      emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to\\n', '      interrupt her while she continued:\\n', '\\n', '      “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive\\n', '      can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You\\n', '      dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if\\n', '      not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing\\n', '      one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and\\n', '      the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving\\n', '      them both in misery of the acutest kind.”\\n', '\\n', '      She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was\\n', '      listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any\\n', '      feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of\\n', '      affected incredulity.\\n', '\\n', '      “Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\\n', '\\n', '      With assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of\\n', '      denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend\\n', '      from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_\\n', '      I have been kinder than towards myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil\\n', '      reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to\\n', '      conciliate her.\\n', '\\n', '      “But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my\\n', '      dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of\\n', '      you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which\\n', '      I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,\\n', '      what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can\\n', '      you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you\\n', '      here impose upon others?”\\n', '\\n', '      “You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said\\n', '      Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\\n', '\\n', '      “Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling\\n', '      an interest in him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his\\n', '      misfortunes have been great indeed.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have\\n', '      reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty.\\n', '      You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been\\n', '      designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of\\n', '      that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You\\n', '      have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his\\n', '      misfortune with contempt and ridicule.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the\\n', '      room, “is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you\\n', '      hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,\\n', '      according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,”\\n', '      added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, “these\\n', '      offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt\\n', '      by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented\\n', '      my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might\\n', '      have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my\\n', '      struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled\\n', '      by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,\\n', '      by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor\\n', '      am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\\n', '      just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\\n', '      connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,\\n', '      whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she\\n', '      tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\\n', '\\n', '      “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of\\n', '      your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared\\n', '      me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you\\n', '      behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.”\\n', '\\n', '      She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she\\n', '      continued:\\n', '\\n', '      “You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible\\n', '      way that would have tempted me to accept it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\\n', '      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\\n', '\\n', '      “From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost\\n', '      say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with\\n', '      the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your\\n', '      selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form\\n', '      the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have\\n', '      built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month\\n', '      before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I\\n', '      could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\\n', '      feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have\\n', '      been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and\\n', '      accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.”\\n', '\\n', '      And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth\\n', '      heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\\n', '\\n', '      The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\\n', '      to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried\\n', '      for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had\\n', '      passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should\\n', '      receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have\\n', '      been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to\\n', '      wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made\\n', '      him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which must\\n', '      appear at least with equal force in his own case—was almost\\n', '      incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so\\n', '      strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his\\n', '      shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his\\n', '      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not\\n', '      justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned\\n', '      Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to\\n', '      deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\\n', '      attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very\\n', '      agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage\\n', '      made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte’s\\n', '      observation, and hurried her away to her room.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 35\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and\\n', '      meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not\\n', '      yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was\\n', '      impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for\\n', '      employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge\\n', '      herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her\\n', '      favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes\\n', '      coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she\\n', '      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\\n', '      park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon\\n', '      passed one of the gates into the ground.\\n', '\\n', '      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she\\n', '      was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the\\n', '      gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now\\n', '      passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and\\n', '      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was\\n', '      on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of\\n', '      a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was\\n', '      moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was\\n', '      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near\\n', '      enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\\n', '      pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself\\n', '      called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she\\n', '      moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it\\n', '      also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took,\\n', '      said, with a look of haughty composure, “I have been walking in\\n', '      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me\\n', '      the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a slight bow,\\n', '      turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\\n', '\\n', '      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest\\n', '      curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still\\n', '      increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of\\n', '      letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The\\n', '      envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the\\n', '      lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight\\n', '      o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—\\n', '\\n', '      “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the\\n', '      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments\\n', '      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to\\n', '      you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling\\n', '      myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,\\n', '      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation\\n', '      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been\\n', '      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.\\n', '      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your\\n', '      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but\\n', '      I demand it of your justice.\\n', '\\n', '      “Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of\\n', '      equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first\\n', '      mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I\\n', '      had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I\\n', '      had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and\\n', '      humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the\\n', '      prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown\\n', '      off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my\\n', '      father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on\\n', '      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its\\n', '      exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two\\n', '      young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few\\n', '      weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that\\n', '      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each\\n', '      circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the\\n', '      following account of my actions and their motives has been read.\\n', '      If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am\\n', '      under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive\\n', '      to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be\\n', '      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\\n', '\\n', '      “I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common\\n', '      with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any\\n', '      other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening\\n', '      of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his\\n', '      feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love\\n', '      before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,\\n', '      I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\\n', '      information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given\\n', '      rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it\\n', '      as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.\\n', '      From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively;\\n', '      and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was\\n', '      beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\\n', '      watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging\\n', '      as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I\\n', '      remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she\\n', '      received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by\\n', '      any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\\n', '      here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of\\n', '      your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have\\n', '      been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment\\n', '      has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,\\n', '      that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such\\n', '      as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,\\n', '      however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily\\n', '      touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is\\n', '      certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and\\n', '      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did\\n', '      not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed\\n', '      it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My\\n', '      objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last\\n', '      night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion\\n', '      to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be\\n', '      so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other\\n', '      causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and\\n', '      existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself\\n', '      endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before\\n', '      me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of\\n', '      your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\\n', '      comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so\\n', '      almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger\\n', '      sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It\\n', '      pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects\\n', '      of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this\\n', '      representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider\\n', '      that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of\\n', '      the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and\\n', '      your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and\\n', '      disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what\\n', '      passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and\\n', '      every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to\\n', '      preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\\n', '      connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following,\\n', '      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon\\n', '      returning.\\n', '\\n', '      “The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’\\n', '      uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence\\n', '      of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time\\n', '      was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on\\n', '      joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I\\n', '      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the\\n', '      certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them\\n', '      earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or\\n', '      delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would\\n', '      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded\\n', '      by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s\\n', '      indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection\\n', '      with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\\n', '      natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than\\n', '      on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived\\n', '      himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against\\n', '      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\\n', '      given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself\\n', '      for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in\\n', '      the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it\\n', '      is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to\\n', '      conceal from him your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself,\\n', '      as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet\\n', '      ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence\\n', '      is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough\\n', '      extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\\n', '      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,\\n', '      and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more\\n', '      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\\n', '      sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives\\n', '      which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,\\n', '      I have not yet learnt to condemn them.\\n', '\\n', '      “With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having\\n', '      injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you\\n', '      the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has\\n', '      _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what\\n', '      I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted\\n', '      veracity.\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for\\n', '      many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose\\n', '      good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my\\n', '      father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was\\n', '      his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My\\n', '      father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most\\n', '      important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the\\n', '      extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a\\n', '      gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young\\n', '      man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also\\n', '      the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his\\n', '      profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it\\n', '      is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very\\n', '      different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle,\\n', '      which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best\\n', '      friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly\\n', '      the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing\\n', '      him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here\\n', '      again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But\\n', '      whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a\\n', '      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his\\n', '      real character—it adds even another motive.\\n', '\\n', '      “My excellent father died about five years ago; and his\\n', '      attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his\\n', '      will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his\\n', '      advancement in the best manner that his profession might\\n', '      allow—and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family\\n', '      living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a\\n', '      legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\\n', '      survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.\\n', '      Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against\\n', '      taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for\\n', '      him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of\\n', '      the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some\\n', '      intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that\\n', '      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient\\n', '      support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be\\n', '      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\\n', '      proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;\\n', '      the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to\\n', '      assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be\\n', '      in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three\\n', '      thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.\\n', '      I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his\\n', '      society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his\\n', '      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all\\n', '      restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For\\n', '      about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of\\n', '      the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he\\n', '      applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\\n', '      circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in\\n', '      believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most\\n', '      unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being\\n', '      ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of\\n', '      which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well\\n', '      assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could\\n', '      not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\\n', '      hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\\n', '      resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in\\n', '      proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was\\n', '      doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his\\n', '      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of\\n', '      acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last\\n', '      summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.\\n', '\\n', '      “I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\\n', '      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should\\n', '      induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I\\n', '      feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten\\n', '      years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s\\n', '      nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she\\n', '      was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in\\n', '      London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over\\n', '      it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly\\n', '      by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance\\n', '      between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most\\n', '      unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far\\n', '      recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart\\n', '      retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child,\\n', '      that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent\\n', '      to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her\\n', '      excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that\\n', '      I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly\\n', '      a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,\\n', '      unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother\\n', '      whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole\\n', '      to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my\\n', '      sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I\\n', '      wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.\\n', '      Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief\\n', '      object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\\n', '      thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of\\n', '      revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge\\n', '      would have been complete indeed.\\n', '\\n', '      “This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we\\n', '      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject\\n', '      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\\n', '      towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form\\n', '      of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not\\n', '      perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of\\n', '      everything concerning either, detection could not be in your\\n', '      power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.\\n', '\\n', '      “You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last\\n', '      night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what\\n', '      could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\\n', '      related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of\\n', '      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant\\n', '      intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father’s\\n', '      will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of\\n', '      these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_\\n', '      assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause\\n', '      from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the\\n', '      possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some\\n', '      opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of\\n', '      the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\\n', '\\n', '      “FITZWILLIAM DARCY”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 36\\n', '\\n', '      If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect\\n', '      it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no\\n', '      expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may\\n', '      well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a\\n', '      contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read\\n', '      were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first\\n', '      understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and\\n', '      steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation\\n', '      to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a\\n', '      strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his\\n', '      account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an\\n', '      eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from\\n', '      impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was\\n', '      incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.\\n', '      His belief of her sister’s insensibility she instantly resolved\\n', '      to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to\\n', '      the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him\\n', '      justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which\\n', '      satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was\\n', '      all pride and insolence.\\n', '\\n', '      But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr.\\n', '      Wickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation\\n', '      of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion\\n', '      of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own\\n', '      history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and\\n', '      more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and\\n', '      even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely,\\n', '      repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false! This cannot be! This\\n', '      must be the grossest falsehood!”—and when she had gone through\\n', '      the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last\\n', '      page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\\n', '      regard it, that she would never look in it again.\\n', '\\n', '      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\\n', '      nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the\\n', '      letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she\\n', '      could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related\\n', '      to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the\\n', '      meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the\\n', '      Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the\\n', '      kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known\\n', '      its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each\\n', '      recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the\\n', '      difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was\\n', '      fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was\\n', '      impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side\\n', '      or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that\\n', '      her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the\\n', '      closest attention, the particulars immediately following of\\n', '      Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his\\n', '      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,\\n', '      again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter,\\n', '      weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\\n', '      impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but\\n', '      with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again\\n', '      she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,\\n', '      which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could\\n', '      so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than\\n', '      infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely\\n', '      blameless throughout the whole.\\n', '\\n', '      The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to\\n', '      lay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more\\n', '      so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never\\n', '      heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in\\n', '      which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on\\n', '      meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight\\n', '      acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in\\n', '      Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character,\\n', '      had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of\\n', '      enquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him\\n', '      at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect\\n', '      some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity\\n', '      or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr.\\n', '      Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for\\n', '      those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what\\n', '      Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\\n', '      continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could\\n', '      see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address;\\n', '      but she could remember no more substantial good than the general\\n', '      approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social\\n', '      powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a\\n', '      considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas!\\n', '      the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received\\n', '      some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel\\n', '      Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she\\n', '      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\\n', '      Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the\\n', '      information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and\\n', '      whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she\\n', '      had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked\\n', '      by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly\\n', '      banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have\\n', '      hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his\\n', '      cousin’s corroboration.\\n', '\\n', '      She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in\\n', '      conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening\\n', '      at Mr. Phillips’s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in\\n', '      her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such\\n', '      communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her\\n', '      before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he\\n', '      had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his\\n', '      conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of\\n', '      seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\\n', '      _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield\\n', '      ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the\\n', '      Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story\\n', '      to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been\\n', '      everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples\\n', '      in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he had assured her that\\n', '      respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.\\n', '\\n', '      How differently did everything now appear in which he was\\n', '      concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence\\n', '      of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of\\n', '      her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but\\n', '      his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself\\n', '      could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been\\n', '      deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his\\n', '      vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had\\n', '      most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour\\n', '      grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.\\n', '      Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned\\n', '      by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair;\\n', '      that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in\\n', '      the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had\\n', '      latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of\\n', '      intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be\\n', '      unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or\\n', '      immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed\\n', '      and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother,\\n', '      and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\\n', '      sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had\\n', '      his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a\\n', '      violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed\\n', '      from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of\\n', '      it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.\\n', '\\n', '      She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor\\n', '      Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind,\\n', '      partial, prejudiced, absurd.\\n', '\\n', '      “How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided\\n', '      myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my\\n', '      abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my\\n', '      sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!\\n', '      How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!\\n', '      Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!\\n', '      But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the\\n', '      preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on\\n', '      the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\\n', '      prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either\\n', '      were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a\\n', '      line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s\\n', '      explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read\\n', '      it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.\\n', '      How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance,\\n', '      which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared\\n', '      himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister’s attachment;\\n', '      and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had\\n', '      always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his\\n', '      description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\\n', '      fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\\n', '      complacency in her air and manner not often united with great\\n', '      sensibility.\\n', '\\n', '      When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\\n', '      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her\\n', '      sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her\\n', '      too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he\\n', '      particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,\\n', '      and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have\\n', '      made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.\\n', '\\n', '      The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It\\n', '      soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had\\n', '      thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she\\n', '      considered that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work\\n', '      of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit\\n', '      of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt\\n', '      depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.\\n', '\\n', '      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\\n', '      variety of thought—re-considering events, determining\\n', '      probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to\\n', '      a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection\\n', '      of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she\\n', '      entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,\\n', '      and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make\\n', '      her unfit for conversation.\\n', '\\n', '      She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had\\n', '      each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few\\n', '      minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been\\n', '      sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and\\n', '      almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.\\n', '      Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she\\n', '      really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an\\n', '      object; she could think only of her letter.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 37\\n', '\\n', '      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins\\n', '      having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting\\n', '      obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of\\n', '      their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits\\n', '      as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone\\n', '      through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady\\n', '      Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with\\n', '      great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that\\n', '      she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having\\n', '      them all to dine with her.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,\\n', '      had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to\\n', '      her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of\\n', '      what her ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she\\n', '      have said? how would she have behaved?” were questions with which\\n', '      she amused herself.\\n', '\\n', '      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I\\n', '      assure you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I\\n', '      believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I\\n', '      am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be\\n', '      so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so\\n', '      they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably\\n', '      till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,\\n', '      more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings\\n', '      certainly increases.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,\\n', '      which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed\\n', '      out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by\\n', '      supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she\\n', '      added:\\n', '\\n', '      “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg\\n', '      that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad\\n', '      of your company, I am sure.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,”\\n', '      replied Elizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I\\n', '      must be in town next Saturday.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I\\n', '      expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before\\n', '      you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.\\n', '      Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if\\n', '      you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to\\n', '      take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in\\n', '      June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the\\n', '      barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and\\n', '      indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not\\n', '      object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\\n', '      original plan.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a\\n', '      servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot\\n', '      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.\\n', '      It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have\\n', '      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young\\n', '      women should always be properly guarded and attended, according\\n', '      to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to\\n', '      Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two\\n', '      men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,\\n', '      of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\\n', '      propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to\\n', '      all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.\\n', '      Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would\\n', '      really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My uncle is to send a servant for us.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad\\n', '      you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you\\n', '      change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at\\n', '      the Bell, you will be attended to.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their\\n', '      journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention\\n', '      was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or,\\n', '      with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.\\n', '      Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was\\n', '      alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day\\n', '      went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in\\n', '      all the delight of unpleasant recollections.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by\\n', '      heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its\\n', '      writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the\\n', '      style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when\\n', '      she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him,\\n', '      her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed\\n', '      feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited\\n', '      gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not\\n', '      approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\\n', '      feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own\\n', '      past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and\\n', '      regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of\\n', '      yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father,\\n', '      contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to\\n', '      restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her\\n', '      mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely\\n', '      insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane\\n', '      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;\\n', '      but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what\\n', '      chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\\n', '      irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always\\n', '      affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,\\n', '      would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and\\n', '      vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt\\n', '      with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they\\n', '      would be going there forever.\\n', '\\n', '      Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.\\n', '      Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good\\n', '      opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His\\n', '      affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct\\n', '      cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness\\n', '      of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the\\n', '      thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so\\n', '      replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been\\n', '      deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\\n', '\\n', '      When to these recollections was added the development of\\n', '      Wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy\\n', '      spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much\\n', '      affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear\\n', '      tolerably cheerful.\\n', '\\n', '      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last\\n', '      week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening\\n', '      was spent there; and her ladyship again enquired minutely into\\n', '      the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the\\n', '      best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of\\n', '      placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself\\n', '      obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and\\n', '      pack her trunk afresh.\\n', '\\n', '      When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,\\n', '      wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford\\n', '      again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to\\n', '      curtsey and hold out her hand to both.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 38\\n', '\\n', '      On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a\\n', '      few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the\\n', '      opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed\\n', '      indispensably necessary.\\n', '\\n', '      “I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has\\n', '      yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I\\n', '      am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving\\n', '      her thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,\\n', '      I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our\\n', '      humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few\\n', '      domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford\\n', '      extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will\\n', '      believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done\\n', '      everything in our power to prevent your spending your time\\n', '      unpleasantly.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.\\n', '      She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of\\n', '      being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received,\\n', '      must make _her_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and\\n', '      with a more smiling solemnity replied:\\n', '\\n', '      “It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your\\n', '      time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most\\n', '      fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very\\n', '      superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the\\n', '      frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may\\n', '      flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been\\n', '      entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s\\n', '      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing\\n', '      which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see\\n', '      how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge\\n', '      that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I\\n', '      should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,\\n', '      while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”\\n', '\\n', '      Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he\\n', '      was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to\\n', '      unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.\\n', '\\n', '      “You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into\\n', '      Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you\\n', '      will be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs.\\n', '      Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust\\n', '      it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but\\n', '      on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure\\n', '      you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most\\n', '      cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte\\n', '      and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in\\n', '      everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas\\n', '      between us. We seem to have been designed for each other.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where\\n', '      that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she\\n', '      firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was\\n', '      not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by\\n', '      the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy\\n', '      to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes\\n', '      open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to\\n', '      go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her\\n', '      housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent\\n', '      concerns, had not yet lost their charms.\\n', '\\n', '      At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the\\n', '      parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After\\n', '      an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was\\n', '      attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down\\n', '      the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all\\n', '      her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had\\n', '      received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr.\\n', '      and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria\\n', '      followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he\\n', '      suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had\\n', '      hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at\\n', '      Rosings.\\n', '\\n', '      “But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble\\n', '      respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their\\n', '      kindness to you while you have been here.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be\\n', '      shut, and the carriage drove off.\\n', '\\n', '      “Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it\\n', '      seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many\\n', '      things have happened!”\\n', '\\n', '      “A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.\\n', '\\n', '      “We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there\\n', '      twice! How much I shall have to tell!”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to\\n', '      conceal!”\\n', '\\n', '      Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any\\n', '      alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they\\n', '      reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a few\\n', '      days.\\n', '\\n', '      Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of\\n', '      studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the\\n', '      kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go\\n', '      home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for\\n', '      observation.\\n', '\\n', '      It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even\\n', '      for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s\\n', '      proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would\\n', '      so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so\\n', '      highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been\\n', '      able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing\\n', '      could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she\\n', '      remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her\\n', '      fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into\\n', '      repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister\\n', '      further.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 39\\n', '\\n', '      It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies\\n', '      set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in\\n', '      Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.\\n', '      Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in\\n', '      token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking\\n', '      out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an\\n', '      hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite\\n', '      milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad\\n', '      and cucumber.\\n', '\\n', '      After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a\\n', '      table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually\\n', '      affords, exclaiming, “Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable\\n', '      surprise?”\\n', '\\n', '      “And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend\\n', '      us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.”\\n', '      Then, showing her purchases—“Look here, I have bought this\\n', '      bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might\\n', '      as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get\\n', '      home, and see if I can make it up any better.”\\n', '\\n', '      And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\\n', '      unconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the\\n', '      shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim\\n', '      it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it\\n', '      will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the\\n', '      ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest\\n', '      satisfaction.\\n', '\\n', '      “They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want\\n', '      papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a\\n', '      delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at\\n', '      all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a\\n', '      miserable summer else we shall have!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme\\n', '      indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,\\n', '      and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset\\n', '      already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of\\n', '      Meryton!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down\\n', '      at table. “What do you think? It is excellent news—capital\\n', '      news—and about a certain person we all like!”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told\\n', '      he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:\\n', '\\n', '      “Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You\\n', '      thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he\\n', '      often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is\\n', '      an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long\\n', '      chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear\\n', '      Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger\\n', '      of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She is gone\\n', '      down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection\\n', '      imprudent as to fortune.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said\\n', '      Jane.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never\\n', '      cared three straws about her—who _could_ about such a nasty\\n', '      little freckled thing?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\\n', '      coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the\\n', '      _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured\\n', '      and fancied liberal!\\n', '\\n', '      As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\\n', '      ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all\\n', '      their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition\\n', '      of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\\n', '\\n', '      “How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I\\n', '      bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another\\n', '      bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk\\n', '      and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear\\n', '      what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen\\n', '      any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes\\n', '      that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.\\n', '      Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost\\n', '      three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being\\n', '      married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to\\n', '      get husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have\\n', '      taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any\\n', '      fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of\\n', '      you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear\\n', '      me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel\\n', '      Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.\\n', '      Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the\\n', '      bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked\\n', '      the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was\\n', '      forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\\n', '      dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for\\n', '      a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel\\n', '      and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were\\n', '      forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how\\n', '      well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or\\n', '      three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the\\n', '      least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I\\n', '      should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and\\n', '      then they soon found out what was the matter.”\\n', '\\n', '      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did\\n', '      Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to\\n', '      amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened\\n', '      as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent\\n', '      mention of Wickham’s name.\\n', '\\n', '      Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to\\n', '      see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner\\n', '      did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:\\n', '\\n', '      “I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\\n', '\\n', '      Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the\\n', '      Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were\\n', '      the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of\\n', '      Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of\\n', '      the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and,\\n', '      on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and\\n', '      Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was\\n', '      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who\\n', '      would hear her.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had\\n', '      such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and\\n', '      pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone\\n', '      so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to\\n', '      the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated\\n', '      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and\\n', '      if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then\\n', '      when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have\\n', '      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we\\n', '      were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,\\n', '      that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\\n', '\\n', '      To this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear\\n', '      sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be\\n', '      congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they\\n', '      would have no charms for _me_—I should infinitely prefer a book.”\\n', '\\n', '      But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\\n', '      anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary\\n', '      at all.\\n', '\\n', '      In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to\\n', '      walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth\\n', '      steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss\\n', '      Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in\\n', '      pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her\\n', '      opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was\\n', '      resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of\\n', '      the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.\\n', '      In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she hoped there\\n', '      could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\\n', '\\n', '      She had not been many hours at home before she found that the\\n', '      Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,\\n', '      was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw\\n', '      directly that her father had not the smallest intention of\\n', '      yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and\\n', '      equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never\\n', '      yet despaired of succeeding at last.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 40\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened\\n', '      could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress\\n', '      every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing\\n', '      her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the\\n', '      chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong\\n', '      sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear\\n', '      perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other\\n', '      feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his\\n', '      sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but\\n', '      still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister’s\\n', '      refusal must have given him.\\n', '\\n', '      “His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and\\n', '      certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it\\n', '      must increase his disappointment!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he\\n', '      has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his\\n', '      regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Blame you! Oh, no.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very\\n', '      next day.”\\n', '\\n', '      She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents\\n', '      as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this\\n', '      for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world\\n', '      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole\\n', '      race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was\\n', '      Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of\\n', '      consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour\\n', '      to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one\\n', '      without involving the other.\\n', '\\n', '      “This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to\\n', '      make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you\\n', '      must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of\\n', '      merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and\\n', '      of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am\\n', '      inclined to believe it all Darcy’s; but you shall do as you\\n', '      choose.”\\n', '\\n', '      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from\\n', '      Jane.\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham\\n', '      so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear\\n', '      Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a\\n', '      disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!\\n', '      and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too\\n', '      distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you\\n', '      so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that\\n', '      I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your\\n', '      profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much\\n', '      longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\\n', '      countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”\\n', '\\n', '      “There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of\\n', '      those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other\\n', '      all the appearance of it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it\\n', '      as you used to do.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a\\n', '      dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s\\n', '      genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.\\n', '      One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but\\n', '      one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then\\n', '      stumbling on something witty.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not\\n', '      treat the matter as you do now.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say\\n', '      unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane\\n', '      to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain\\n', '      and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!”\\n', '\\n', '      “How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong\\n', '      expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they\\n', '      _do_ appear wholly undeserved.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a\\n', '      most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been\\n', '      encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I\\n', '      want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our\\n', '      acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can\\n', '      be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your\\n', '      opinion?”\\n', '\\n', '      “That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised\\n', '      me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every\\n', '      particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as\\n', '      possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to\\n', '      the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general\\n', '      prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the\\n', '      death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him\\n', '      in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be\\n', '      gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he\\n', '      really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we\\n', '      may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present\\n', '      I will say nothing about it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin\\n', '      him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and\\n', '      anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him\\n', '      desperate.”\\n', '\\n', '      The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation.\\n', '      She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her\\n', '      for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,\\n', '      whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was\\n', '      still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the\\n', '      disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s\\n', '      letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been\\n', '      valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could\\n', '      partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\\n', '      understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing\\n', '      off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\\n', '      that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely\\n', '      be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable\\n', '      manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till\\n', '      it has lost all its value!”\\n', '\\n', '      She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the\\n', '      real state of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still\\n', '      cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even\\n', '      fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of\\n', '      first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater\\n', '      steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so\\n', '      fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every\\n', '      other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the\\n', '      feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence\\n', '      of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health\\n', '      and their tranquillity.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion\\n', '      _now_ of this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am\\n', '      determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my\\n', '      sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane\\n', '      saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving\\n', '      young man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the\\n', '      world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming\\n', '      to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of\\n', '      everybody, too, who is likely to know.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come.\\n', '      Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and\\n', '      if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort\\n', '      is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will\\n', '      be sorry for what he has done.”\\n', '\\n', '      But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such\\n', '      expectation, she made no answer.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the\\n', '      Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope\\n', '      it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is\\n', '      an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her\\n', '      mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in\\n', '      _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, nothing at all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.\\n', '      _They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will\\n', '      never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!\\n', '      And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your\\n', '      father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,\\n', '      whenever that happens.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt\\n', '      they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be\\n', '      easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the\\n', '      better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only\\n', '      entailed on me.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 41\\n', '\\n', '      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.\\n', '      It was the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the\\n', '      young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The\\n', '      dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were\\n', '      still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course\\n', '      of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for\\n', '      this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was\\n', '      extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in\\n', '      any of the family.\\n', '\\n', '      “Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would\\n', '      they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be\\n', '      smiling so, Lizzy?”\\n', '\\n', '      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered\\n', '      what she had herself endured on a similar occasion,\\n', '      five-and-twenty years ago.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when\\n', '      Colonel Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have\\n', '      broken my heart.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.\\n', '\\n', '      “If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so\\n', '      disagreeable.”\\n', '\\n', '      “A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of\\n', '      good,” added Kitty.\\n', '\\n', '      Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\\n', '      Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all\\n', '      sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of\\n', '      Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she been so much disposed\\n', '      to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.\\n', '\\n', '      But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for\\n', '      she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the\\n', '      colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This\\n', '      invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately\\n', '      married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had\\n', '      recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_\\n', '      months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\\n', '\\n', '      The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.\\n', '      Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of\\n', '      Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her\\n', '      sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless\\n', '      ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and\\n', '      talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty\\n', '      continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as\\n', '      unreasonable as her accent was peevish.\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as\\n', '      Lydia,” said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I\\n', '      have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for\\n', '      I am two years older.”\\n', '\\n', '      In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to\\n', '      make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was\\n', '      so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother\\n', '      and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all\\n', '      possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as\\n', '      such a step must make her were it known, she could not help\\n', '      secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented\\n', '      to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the\\n', '      little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a\\n', '      woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\\n', '      imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the\\n', '      temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her\\n', '      attentively, and then said:\\n', '\\n', '      “Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some\\n', '      public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with\\n', '      so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the\\n', '      present circumstances.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great\\n', '      disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of\\n', '      Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already\\n', '      arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the\\n', '      affair.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened\\n', '      away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast\\n', '      down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a\\n', '      little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the\\n', '      list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s\\n', '      folly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It\\n', '      is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now\\n', '      complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must\\n', '      be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of\\n', '      all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must\\n', '      speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble\\n', '      of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her\\n', '      present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will\\n', '      soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be\\n', '      fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\\n', '      that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in\\n', '      the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any\\n', '      attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the\\n', '      ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off\\n', '      any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for\\n', '      admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is\\n', '      comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\\n', '      ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,\\n', '      can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and\\n', '      despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not\\n', '      be often involved in the disgrace?”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\\n', '      affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\\n', '\\n', '      “Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are\\n', '      known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear\\n', '      to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very\\n', '      silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does\\n', '      not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a\\n', '      sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she\\n', '      is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At\\n', '      Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt\\n', '      than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth\\n', '      their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may\\n', '      teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\\n', '      many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the\\n', '      rest of her life.”\\n', '\\n', '      With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own\\n', '      opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and\\n', '      sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her\\n', '      vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having\\n', '      performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or\\n', '      augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.\\n', '\\n', '      Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference\\n', '      with her father, their indignation would hardly have found\\n', '      expression in their united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a\\n', '      visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly\\n', '      happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets\\n', '      of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself\\n', '      the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present\\n', '      unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched\\n', '      forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\\n', '      and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the\\n', '      view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting\\n', '      with at least six officers at once.\\n', '\\n', '      Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects\\n', '      and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?\\n', '      They could have been understood only by her mother, who might\\n', '      have felt nearly the same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that\\n', '      consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband’s never\\n', '      intending to go there himself.\\n', '\\n', '      But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their\\n', '      raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of\\n', '      Lydia’s leaving home.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having\\n', '      been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation\\n', '      was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality\\n', '      entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very\\n', '      gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a\\n', '      sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to\\n', '      herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the\\n', '      inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\\n', '      had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,\\n', '      after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern\\n', '      for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such\\n', '      idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed\\n', '      it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing,\\n', '      that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had\\n', '      been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference\\n', '      secured at any time by their renewal.\\n', '\\n', '      On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he\\n', '      dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little\\n', '      was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on\\n', '      his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had\\n', '      passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr.\\n', '      Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him,\\n', '      if he was acquainted with the former.\\n', '\\n', '      He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s\\n', '      recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly\\n', '      seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very\\n', '      gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer\\n', '      was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon\\n', '      afterwards added:\\n', '\\n', '      “How long did you say he was at Rosings?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nearly three weeks.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And you saw him frequently?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, almost every day.”\\n', '\\n', '      “His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon\\n', '      acquaintance.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her.\\n', '      “And pray, may I ask?—” But checking himself, he added, in a\\n', '      gayer tone, “Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to\\n', '      add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not\\n', '      hope,” he continued in a lower and more serious tone, “that he is\\n', '      improved in essentials.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very\\n', '      much what he ever was.”\\n', '\\n', '      While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\\n', '      rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\\n', '      something in her countenance which made him listen with an\\n', '      apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:\\n', '\\n', '      “When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean\\n', '      that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but\\n', '      that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better\\n', '      understood.”\\n', '\\n', '      Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and\\n', '      agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off\\n', '      his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the\\n', '      gentlest of accents:\\n', '\\n', '      “You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\\n', '      comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to\\n', '      assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that\\n', '      direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,\\n', '      for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have\\n', '      suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which\\n', '      you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his\\n', '      visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands\\n', '      much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when\\n', '      they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish\\n', '      of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain\\n', '      he has very much at heart.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered\\n', '      only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted\\n', '      to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was\\n', '      in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with\\n', '      the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no\\n', '      further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last\\n', '      with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never\\n', '      meeting again.\\n', '\\n', '      When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to\\n', '      Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.\\n', '      The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than\\n', '      pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep\\n', '      from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good\\n', '      wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her\\n', '      injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying\\n', '      herself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason\\n', '      to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous\\n', '      happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle\\n', '      adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 42\\n', '\\n', '      Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she\\n', '      could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal\\n', '      felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and\\n', '      beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty\\n', '      generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and\\n', '      illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all\\n', '      real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had\\n', '      vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were\\n', '      overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek\\n', '      comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had\\n', '      brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the\\n', '      unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the\\n', '      country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his\\n', '      principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise\\n', '      indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his\\n', '      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in\\n', '      general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of\\n', '      entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive\\n', '      benefit from such as are given.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of\\n', '      her father’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with\\n', '      pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his\\n', '      affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what\\n', '      she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that\\n', '      continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in\\n', '      exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so\\n', '      highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now\\n', '      the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable\\n', '      a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\\n', '      from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,\\n', '      rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of\\n', '      his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his\\n', '      wife.\\n', '\\n', '      When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found\\n', '      little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.\\n', '      Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home\\n', '      she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the\\n', '      dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their\\n', '      domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her\\n', '      natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were\\n', '      removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil\\n', '      might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly\\n', '      and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a\\n', '      watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found,\\n', '      what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she\\n', '      had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking\\n', '      place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It\\n', '      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the\\n', '      commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which\\n', '      her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the\\n', '      pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and\\n', '      prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now\\n', '      the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\\n', '      for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her\\n', '      mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included\\n', '      Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\\n', '\\n', '      “But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to\\n', '      wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment\\n', '      would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless\\n', '      source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to\\n', '      have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which\\n', '      every part promises delight can never be successful; and general\\n', '      disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little\\n', '      peculiar vexation.”\\n', '\\n', '      When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very\\n', '      minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always\\n', '      long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother\\n', '      contained little else than that they were just returned from the\\n', '      library, where such and such officers had attended them, and\\n', '      where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite\\n', '      wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would\\n', '      have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\\n', '      violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going\\n', '      off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister,\\n', '      there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty,\\n', '      though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words\\n', '      to be made public.\\n', '\\n', '      After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\\n', '      good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.\\n', '      Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in\\n', '      town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer\\n', '      engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual\\n', '      querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much\\n', '      recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event\\n', '      of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the\\n', '      following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not\\n', '      to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and\\n', '      malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should\\n', '      be quartered in Meryton.\\n', '\\n', '      The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now\\n', '      fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a\\n', '      letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its\\n', '      commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be\\n', '      prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in\\n', '      July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that\\n', '      left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as\\n', '      they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and\\n', '      comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the\\n', '      Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to\\n', '      the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than\\n', '      Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy\\n', '      the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a\\n', '      peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly\\n', '      passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a\\n', '      few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all\\n', '      the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the\\n', '      Peak.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on\\n', '      seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time\\n', '      enough. But it was her business to be satisfied—and certainly her\\n', '      temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.\\n', '\\n', '      With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.\\n', '      It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of\\n', '      Pemberley and its owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his\\n', '      county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without\\n', '      his perceiving me.”\\n', '\\n', '      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to\\n', '      pass away before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass\\n', '      away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at\\n', '      length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and\\n', '      eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the\\n', '      particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general\\n', '      favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly\\n', '      adapted her for attending to them in every way—teaching them,\\n', '      playing with them, and loving them.\\n', '\\n', '      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the\\n', '      next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.\\n', '      One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a\\n', '      suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\\n', '      inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and\\n', '      affection and intelligence, which might supply it among\\n', '      themselves if there were disappointments abroad.\\n', '\\n', '      It is not the object of this work to give a description of\\n', '      Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which\\n', '      their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,\\n', '      Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of\\n', '      Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of\\n', '      Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where\\n', '      she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they\\n', '      bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of\\n', '      the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found\\n', '      from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their\\n', '      direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking\\n', '      over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\\n', '      inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\\n', '      willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\\n', '\\n', '      “My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have\\n', '      heard so much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many\\n', '      of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth\\n', '      there, you know.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\\n', '      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing\\n', '      it. She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after\\n', '      going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or\\n', '      satin curtains.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine\\n', '      house richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it\\n', '      myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the\\n', '      finest woods in the country.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth said no more—but her mind could not acquiesce. The\\n', '      possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,\\n', '      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very\\n', '      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt\\n', '      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;\\n', '      and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if\\n', '      her private enquiries to the absence of the family were\\n', '      unfavourably answered.\\n', '\\n', '      Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\\n', '      whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name\\n', '      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family\\n', '      were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the\\n', '      last question—and her alarms now being removed, she was at\\n', '      leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house\\n', '      herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and\\n', '      she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper\\n', '      air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the\\n', '      scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 43\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance\\n', '      of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length\\n', '      they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\\n', '\\n', '      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.\\n', '      They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some\\n', '      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and\\n', '      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually\\n', '      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of\\n', '      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was\\n', '      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite\\n', '      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.\\n', '      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising\\n', '      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,\\n', '      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but\\n', '      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal\\n', '      nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen\\n', '      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty\\n', '      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\\n', '      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt\\n', '      that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\\n', '\\n', '      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the\\n', '      door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all\\n', '      her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest\\n', '      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,\\n', '      they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited\\n', '      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she\\n', '      was.\\n', '\\n', '      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much\\n', '      less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding\\n', '      her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large,\\n', '      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after\\n', '      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.\\n', '      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving\\n', '      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.\\n', '      Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the\\n', '      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the\\n', '      winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with\\n', '      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were\\n', '      taking different positions; but from every window there were\\n', '      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their\\n', '      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but\\n', '      Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither\\n', '      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real\\n', '      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\\n', '\\n', '      “And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress!\\n', '      With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!\\n', '      Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in\\n', '      them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and\\n', '      aunt. But no,”—recollecting herself—“that could never be; my\\n', '      uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been\\n', '      allowed to invite them.”\\n', '\\n', '      This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very\\n', '      like regret.\\n', '\\n', '      She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was\\n', '      really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,\\n', '      the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with\\n', '      alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we\\n', '      expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends.” How\\n', '      rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any\\n', '      circumstance been delayed a day!\\n', '\\n', '      Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and\\n', '      saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\\n', '      miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly,\\n', '      how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it\\n', '      was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s\\n', '      steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He\\n', '      is now gone into the army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has\\n', '      turned out very wild.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth\\n', '      could not return it.\\n', '\\n', '      “And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the\\n', '      miniatures, “is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the\\n', '      same time as the other—about eight years ago.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner, looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But,\\n', '      Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\\n', '      intimation of her knowing her master.\\n', '\\n', '      “Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, very handsome.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up\\n', '      stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.\\n', '      This room was my late master’s favourite room, and these\\n', '      miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of\\n', '      them.”\\n', '\\n', '      This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,\\n', '      drawn when she was only eight years old.\\n', '\\n', '      “And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\\n', '      accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room\\n', '      is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my\\n', '      master; she comes here to-morrow with him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,\\n', '      encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks;\\n', '      Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great\\n', '      pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.\\n', '\\n', '      “Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend\\n', '      half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer\\n', '      months.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know\\n', '      who is good enough for him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,\\n', '      “It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think\\n', '      so.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows\\n', '      him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty\\n', '      far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the\\n', '      housekeeper added, “I have never known a cross word from him in\\n', '      my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old.”\\n', '\\n', '      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite\\n', '      to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her\\n', '      firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed\\n', '      to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:\\n', '\\n', '      “There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are\\n', '      lucky in having such a master.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I\\n', '      could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that\\n', '      they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when\\n', '      they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most\\n', '      generous-hearted boy in the world.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought\\n', '      she.\\n', '\\n', '      “His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like\\n', '      him—just as affable to the poor.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for\\n', '      more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She\\n', '      related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the\\n', '      rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,\\n', '      highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he\\n', '      attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led\\n', '      again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many\\n', '      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\\n', '\\n', '      “He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that\\n', '      ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of\\n', '      nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or\\n', '      servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him\\n', '      proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it\\n', '      is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.”\\n', '\\n', '      “In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought\\n', '      Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked,\\n', '      “is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps we might be deceived.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\\n', '\\n', '      On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very\\n', '      pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and\\n', '      lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it\\n', '      was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a\\n', '      liking to the room when last at Pemberley.\\n', '\\n', '      “He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked\\n', '      towards one of the windows.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should\\n', '      enter the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added.\\n', '      “Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in\\n', '      a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her.”\\n', '\\n', '      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,\\n', '      were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good\\n', '      paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such\\n', '      as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to\\n', '      look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects\\n', '      were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.\\n', '\\n', '      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could\\n', '      have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked\\n', '      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.\\n', '      At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to\\n', '      Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to\\n', '      have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several\\n', '      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and\\n', '      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.\\n', '      Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s\\n', '      lifetime.\\n', '\\n', '      There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more\\n', '      gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at\\n', '      the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on\\n', '      him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is\\n', '      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a\\n', '      brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people’s\\n', '      happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain\\n', '      was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be\\n', '      done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the\\n', '      housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood\\n', '      before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes\\n', '      upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment\\n', '      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its\\n', '      warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.\\n', '\\n', '      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had\\n', '      been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the\\n', '      housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at\\n', '      the hall-door.\\n', '\\n', '      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth\\n', '      turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and\\n', '      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,\\n', '      the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,\\n', '      which led behind it to the stables.\\n', '\\n', '      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was\\n', '      his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their\\n', '      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with\\n', '      the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed\\n', '      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced\\n', '      towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of\\n', '      perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.\\n', '\\n', '      She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\\n', '      received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\\n', '      overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the\\n', '      picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure\\n', '      the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s\\n', '      expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately\\n', '      have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to\\n', '      their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift\\n', '      her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to\\n', '      his civil enquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of\\n', '      his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered\\n', '      was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\\n', '      impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the\\n', '      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most\\n', '      uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease;\\n', '      when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and\\n', '      he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left\\n', '      Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so\\n', '      hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.\\n', '\\n', '      At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a\\n', '      few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected\\n', '      himself, and took leave.\\n', '\\n', '      The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his\\n', '      figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by\\n', '      her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered\\n', '      by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate,\\n', '      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must\\n', '      appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so\\n', '      vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself\\n', '      in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come\\n', '      a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\\n', '      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\\n', '      discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment\\n', '      arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She\\n', '      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And\\n', '      his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he\\n', '      should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such\\n', '      civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she\\n', '      seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with\\n', '      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast\\n', '      did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his\\n', '      letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\\n', '      account for it.\\n', '\\n', '      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,\\n', '      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a\\n', '      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it\\n', '      was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,\\n', '      though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her\\n', '      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as\\n', '      they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her\\n', '      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,\\n', '      whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to\\n', '      know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he\\n', '      thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was\\n', '      still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt\\n', '      himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\\n', '      not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\\n', '      seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her\\n', '      with composure.\\n', '\\n', '      At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence\\n', '      of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more\\n', '      like herself.\\n', '\\n', '      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a\\n', '      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where\\n', '      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many\\n', '      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long\\n', '      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the\\n', '      stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole\\n', '      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant\\n', '      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the\\n', '      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought\\n', '      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to\\n', '      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They\\n', '      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air\\n', '      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet\\n', '      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed\\n', '      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough\\n', '      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its\\n', '      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived\\n', '      their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great\\n', '      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the\\n', '      carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore,\\n', '      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on\\n', '      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but\\n', '      their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to\\n', '      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much\\n', '      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in\\n', '      the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced\\n', '      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were\\n', '      again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to\\n', '      what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching\\n', '      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\\n', '      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\\n', '      they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more\\n', '      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and\\n', '      to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a\\n', '      few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into\\n', '      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk\\n', '      concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was\\n', '      immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost\\n', '      none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she\\n', '      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she\\n', '      had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when\\n', '      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise\\n', '      of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her\\n', '      colour changed, and she said no more.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing,\\n', '      he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to\\n', '      her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was\\n', '      quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his\\n', '      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people\\n', '      against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself.\\n', '      “What will be his surprise,” thought she, “when he knows who they\\n', '      are? He takes them now for people of fashion.”\\n', '\\n', '      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named\\n', '      their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to\\n', '      see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his\\n', '      decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.\\n', '      That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he\\n', '      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going\\n', '      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but\\n', '      triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\\n', '      relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\\n', '      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\\n', '      expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his\\n', '      intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.\\n', '\\n', '      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr.\\n', '      Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as\\n', '      often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood,\\n', '      offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and\\n', '      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually\\n', '      most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with\\n', '      Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said\\n', '      nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be\\n', '      all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\\n', '      continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what\\n', '      can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake\\n', '      that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could\\n', '      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should\\n', '      still love me.”\\n', '\\n', '      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the\\n', '      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending\\n', '      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some\\n', '      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It\\n', '      originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the\\n', '      morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and\\n', '      consequently preferred her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by\\n', '      her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,\\n', '      the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been\\n', '      assured of his absence before she came to the place, and\\n', '      accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very\\n', '      unexpected—“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\\n', '      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,\\n', '      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not\\n', '      immediately expected in the country.” He acknowledged the truth\\n', '      of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned\\n', '      his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with\\n', '      whom he had been travelling. “They will join me early to-morrow,”\\n', '      he continued, “and among them are some who will claim an\\n', '      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were\\n', '      instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had\\n', '      been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by\\n', '      his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.\\n', '\\n', '      “There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after\\n', '      a pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will\\n', '      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to\\n', '      your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?”\\n', '\\n', '      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too\\n', '      great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She\\n', '      immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of\\n', '      being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and,\\n', '      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying\\n', '      to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of\\n', '      her.\\n', '\\n', '      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.\\n', '      Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was\\n', '      flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her\\n', '      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the\\n', '      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.\\n', '\\n', '      He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself\\n', '      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time\\n', '      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She\\n', '      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every\\n', '      subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling,\\n', '      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.\\n', '      Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas\\n', '      were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\\n', '\\n', '      On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go\\n', '      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,\\n', '      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy\\n', '      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,\\n', '      Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.\\n', '\\n', '      The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of\\n', '      them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they\\n', '      had expected. “He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and\\n', '      unassuming,” said her uncle.\\n', '\\n', '      “There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,”\\n', '      replied her aunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not\\n', '      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some\\n', '      people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was\\n', '      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no\\n', '      necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was\\n', '      very trifling.”\\n', '\\n', '      “To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as\\n', '      Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his\\n', '      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he\\n', '      was so disagreeable?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had\\n', '      liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that\\n', '      she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.\\n', '\\n', '      “But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,”\\n', '      replied her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I\\n', '      shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind\\n', '      another day, and warn me off his grounds.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his\\n', '      character, but said nothing.\\n', '\\n', '      “From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I\\n', '      really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so\\n', '      cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not\\n', '      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing\\n', '      about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity\\n', '      in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea\\n', '      of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his\\n', '      house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help\\n', '      laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose,\\n', '      and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in\\n', '      vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them\\n', '      to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what\\n', '      she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were\\n', '      capable of a very different construction; and that his character\\n', '      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had\\n', '      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she\\n', '      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in\\n', '      which they had been connected, without actually naming her\\n', '      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\\n', '      approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave\\n', '      way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in\\n', '      pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its\\n', '      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by\\n', '      the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off\\n', '      again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was\\n', '      spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many\\n', '      years’ discontinuance.\\n', '\\n', '      The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave\\n', '      Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she\\n', '      could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s\\n', '      civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted\\n', '      with his sister.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 44\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to\\n', '      visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was\\n', '      consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole\\n', '      of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very\\n', '      morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They\\n', '      had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,\\n', '      and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining\\n', '      with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a\\n', '      window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving\\n', '      up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,\\n', '      guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\\n', '      surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour\\n', '      which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and\\n', '      the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the\\n', '      circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the\\n', '      preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing\\n', '      had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no\\n', '      other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter\\n', '      than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\\n', '      newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation\\n', '      of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was\\n', '      quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of\\n', '      disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should\\n', '      have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious\\n', '      to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing\\n', '      would fail her.\\n', '\\n', '      She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she\\n', '      walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw\\n', '      such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made\\n', '      everything worse.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable\\n', '      introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that\\n', '      her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.\\n', '      Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was\\n', '      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes\\n', '      convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it\\n', '      difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,\\n', '      though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her\\n', '      appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her\\n', '      brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her\\n', '      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had\\n', '      expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as\\n', '      ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such\\n', '      different feelings.\\n', '\\n', '      They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that\\n', '      Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time\\n', '      to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when\\n', '      Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he\\n', '      entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long\\n', '      done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood\\n', '      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he\\n', '      expressed himself on seeing her again. He enquired in a friendly,\\n', '      though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with\\n', '      the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\\n', '\\n', '      To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting\\n', '      personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The\\n', '      whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The\\n', '      suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece\\n', '      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though\\n', '      guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full\\n', '      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of\\n', '      the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that\\n', '      the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain\\n', '      the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her\\n', '      own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter\\n', '      object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of\\n', '      success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were\\n', '      prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was\\n', '      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\\n', '\\n', '      In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister;\\n', '      and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his\\n', '      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he\\n', '      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased\\n', '      herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying\\n', '      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she\\n', '      could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had\\n', '      been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side\\n', '      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that\\n', '      could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon\\n', '      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere\\n', '      they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\\n', '      recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of\\n', '      saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.\\n', '      He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking\\n', '      together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that\\n', '      it “was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing\\n', '      her;” and, before she could reply, he added, “It is above eight\\n', '      months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were\\n', '      all dancing together at Netherfield.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he\\n', '      afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of\\n', '      the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was\\n', '      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there\\n', '      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.\\n', '\\n', '      It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy\\n', '      himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an\\n', '      expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she\\n', '      heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his\\n', '      companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners\\n', '      which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence\\n', '      might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus\\n', '      seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people\\n', '      with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\\n', '      disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to\\n', '      the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected\\n', '      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the\\n', '      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she\\n', '      could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never,\\n', '      even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his\\n', '      dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to\\n', '      please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as\\n', '      now, when no importance could result from the success of his\\n', '      endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his\\n', '      attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and\\n', '      censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.\\n', '\\n', '      Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they\\n', '      arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in\\n', '      expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss\\n', '      Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.\\n', '      Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in\\n', '      the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner\\n', '      looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the\\n', '      invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,\\n', '      but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that\\n', '      this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment\\n', '      than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who\\n', '      was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she\\n', '      ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next\\n', '      was fixed on.\\n', '\\n', '      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing\\n', '      Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and\\n', '      many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.\\n', '      Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak\\n', '      of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some\\n', '      others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of\\n', '      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though\\n', '      while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager\\n', '      to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and\\n', '      aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\\n', '      favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\\n', '\\n', '      But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;\\n', '      it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident\\n', '      that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had\\n', '      before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love\\n', '      with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify\\n', '      enquiry.\\n', '\\n', '      Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,\\n', '      as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.\\n', '      They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn\\n', '      his character from their own feelings and his servant’s report,\\n', '      without any reference to any other account, the circle in\\n', '      Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it\\n', '      for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing\\n', '      the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority\\n', '      of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and\\n', '      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily\\n', '      rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\\n', '      their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.\\n', '      They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably\\n', '      had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants\\n', '      of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was\\n', '      acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much\\n', '      good among the poor.\\n', '\\n', '      With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was\\n', '      not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his\\n', '      concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood,\\n', '      it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he\\n', '      had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards\\n', '      discharged.\\n', '\\n', '      As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening\\n', '      more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it\\n', '      seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings\\n', '      towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours\\n', '      endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him.\\n', '      No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been\\n', '      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so\\n', '      called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable\\n', '      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\\n', '      time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now\\n', '      heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony\\n', '      so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in\\n', '      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,\\n', '      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of\\n', '      goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;\\n', '      gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving\\n', '      her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony\\n', '      of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\\n', '      accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would\\n', '      avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental\\n', '      meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any\\n', '      indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\\n', '      their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\\n', '      opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his\\n', '      sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only\\n', '      astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be\\n', '      attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be\\n', '      encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\\n', '      exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to\\n', '      him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted\\n', '      to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself,\\n', '      and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should\\n', '      employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed,\\n', '      of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.\\n', '\\n', '      It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the\\n', '      niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to\\n', '      see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had\\n', '      reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though\\n', '      it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their\\n', '      side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to\\n', '      wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were,\\n', '      therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked\\n', '      herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme\\n', '      had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made\\n', '      of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 45\\n', '\\n', '      Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her\\n', '      had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how\\n', '      unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was\\n', '      curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side the\\n', '      acquaintance would now be renewed.\\n', '\\n', '      On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the\\n', '      saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.\\n', '      Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing\\n', '      view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the\\n', '      beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over\\n', '      the intermediate lawn.\\n', '\\n', '      In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting\\n', '      there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom\\n', '      she lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very\\n', '      civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though\\n', '      proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily\\n', '      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her\\n', '      being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however,\\n', '      did her justice, and pitied her.\\n', '\\n', '      By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a\\n', '      curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such\\n', '      pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first\\n', '      broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,\\n', '      whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to\\n', '      be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between\\n', '      her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the\\n', '      conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished\\n', '      for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\\n', '      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss\\n', '      Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss\\n', '      Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not\\n', '      have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they\\n', '      not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not\\n', '      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts\\n', '      were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the\\n', '      gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the\\n', '      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished\\n', '      or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in\\n', '      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley’s\\n', '      voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry\\n', '      after the health of her family. She answered with equal\\n', '      indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\\n', '\\n', '      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\\n', '      entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all\\n', '      the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till\\n', '      after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to\\n', '      Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was\\n', '      now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all\\n', '      talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,\\n', '      nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.\\n', '\\n', '      While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding\\n', '      whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.\\n', '      Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room;\\n', '      and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes\\n', '      to predominate, she began to regret that he came.\\n', '\\n', '      He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three\\n', '      other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had\\n', '      left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended\\n', '      a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than\\n', '      Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;\\n', '      a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the\\n', '      more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the\\n', '      whole party were awakened against them, and that there was\\n', '      scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first\\n', '      came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so\\n', '      strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles\\n', '      which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\\n', '      objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her\\n', '      attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her\\n', '      brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and\\n', '      Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to\\n', '      get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt\\n', '      at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this\\n', '      likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first\\n', '      opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\\n', '\\n', '      “Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from\\n', '      Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\\n', '\\n', '      In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but\\n', '      Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her\\n', '      thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave\\n', '      her a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel\\n', '      the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a\\n', '      tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance\\n', '      showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking\\n', '      at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to\\n', '      lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then\\n', '      giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained\\n', '      from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\\n', '      Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she\\n', '      believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which\\n', '      might injure her in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the\\n', '      latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of\\n', '      her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had\\n', '      ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no\\n', '      creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except\\n', '      to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her brother was\\n', '      particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which\\n', '      Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\\n', '      hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and\\n', '      without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate\\n', '      him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something\\n', '      to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his\\n', '      emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not\\n', '      approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,\\n', '      though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother,\\n', '      whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest\\n', '      in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed\\n', '      to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on\\n', '      her more and more cheerfully.\\n', '\\n', '      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer\\n', '      above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their\\n', '      carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on\\n', '      Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not\\n', '      join her. Her brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her\\n', '      favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such\\n', '      terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of\\n', '      finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy\\n', '      returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\\n', '      him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\\n', '\\n', '      “How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,”\\n', '      she cried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she\\n', '      is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and\\n', '      I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.”\\n', '\\n', '      However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he\\n', '      contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other\\n', '      alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous\\n', '      consequence of travelling in the summer.\\n', '\\n', '      “For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never\\n', '      could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion\\n', '      has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her\\n', '      nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her\\n', '      teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for\\n', '      her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never\\n', '      see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish\\n', '      look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there\\n', '      is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable.”\\n', '\\n', '      Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this\\n', '      was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people\\n', '      are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat\\n', '      nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely\\n', '      silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak,\\n', '      she continued:\\n', '\\n', '      “I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed\\n', '      we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I\\n', '      particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been\\n', '      dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_ a beauty!—I should as soon call her\\n', '      mother a wit.’ But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I\\n', '      believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but\\n', '      _that_ was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since\\n', '      I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my\\n', '      acquaintance.”\\n', '\\n', '      He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the\\n', '      satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any\\n', '      pain but herself.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred\\n', '      during their visit, as they returned, except what had\\n', '      particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of\\n', '      everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who\\n', '      had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister,\\n', '      his friends, his house, his fruit—of everything but himself; yet\\n', '      Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him,\\n', '      and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s\\n', '      beginning the subject.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 46\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a\\n', '      letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this\\n', '      disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had\\n', '      now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and\\n', '      her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at\\n', '      once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent\\n', '      elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written\\n', '      the direction remarkably ill.\\n', '\\n', '      They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and\\n', '      her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off\\n', '      by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had\\n', '      been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of\\n', '      all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the\\n', '      country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day\\n', '      later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important\\n', '      intelligence. It was to this effect:\\n', '\\n', '      “Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred\\n', '      of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of\\n', '      alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say\\n', '      relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just\\n', '      as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us\\n', '      that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to\\n', '      own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty,\\n', '      however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very\\n', '      sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to\\n', '      hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\\n', '      Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this\\n', '      step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His\\n', '      choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can\\n', '      give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father\\n', '      bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know\\n', '      what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They\\n', '      were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were\\n', '      not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent\\n', '      off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten\\n', '      miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here\\n', '      soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their\\n', '      intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\\n', '      mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I\\n', '      hardly know what I have written.”\\n', '\\n', '      Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely\\n', '      knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter\\n', '      instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost\\n', '      impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than\\n', '      the conclusion of the first.\\n', '\\n', '      “By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried\\n', '      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not\\n', '      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer\\n', '      for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\\n', '      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\\n', '      Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia\\n', '      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,\\n', '      for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to\\n', '      Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton\\n', '      the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s\\n', '      short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were\\n', '      going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing\\n', '      his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia\\n', '      at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking\\n', '      the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did\\n', '      trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering\\n', '      that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the\\n', '      chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this\\n', '      is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not\\n', '      what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side\\n', '      London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing\\n', '      them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and\\n', '      Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to\\n', '      pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn,\\n', '      and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to\\n', '      his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one\\n', '      can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very\\n', '      great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think\\n', '      so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for\\n', '      them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first\\n', '      plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young\\n', '      woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose\\n', '      her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,\\n', '      that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he\\n', '      shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.\\n', '      was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and\\n', '      keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but\\n', '      this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my\\n', '      life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having\\n', '      concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,\\n', '      one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have\\n', '      been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as\\n', '      the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?\\n', '      I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if\\n', '      inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have\\n', '      just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I\\n', '      cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as\\n', '      possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\\n', '      afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to\\n', '      ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel\\n', '      Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I\\n', '      am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him\\n', '      to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel\\n', '      Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In\\n', '      such an exigence, my uncle’s advice and assistance would be\\n', '      everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I\\n', '      must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her\\n', '      seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him,\\n', '      without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she\\n', '      reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy\\n', '      appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and\\n', '      before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind\\n', '      every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily\\n', '      exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I\\n', '      have not an instant to lose.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than\\n', '      politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a\\n', '      minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she\\n', '      felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.\\n', '      Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though\\n', '      in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to\\n', '      fetch his master and mistress home instantly.\\n', '\\n', '      On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself,\\n', '      and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to\\n', '      leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and\\n', '      commiseration, “Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could\\n', '      take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you\\n', '      one? You are very ill.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.\\n', '      “There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only\\n', '      distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from\\n', '      Longbourn.”\\n', '\\n', '      She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes\\n', '      could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could\\n', '      only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her\\n', '      in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. “I have just\\n', '      had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be\\n', '      concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her\\n', '      friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr.\\n', '      Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him\\n', '      too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections,\\n', '      nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever.”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in\\n', '      a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_ might have prevented it! _I_\\n', '      who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it\\n', '      only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his\\n', '      character been known, this could not have happened. But it is\\n', '      all—all too late now.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved—shocked. But is it\\n', '      certain—absolutely certain?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were\\n', '      traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not\\n', '      gone to Scotland.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover\\n', '      her?”\\n', '\\n', '      “My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my\\n', '      uncle’s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in\\n', '      half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that\\n', '      nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are\\n', '      they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is\\n', '      every way horrible!”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\\n', '\\n', '      “When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known\\n', '      what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of\\n', '      doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was\\n', '      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow\\n', '      contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and\\n', '      instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything _must_\\n', '      sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of\\n', '      the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but\\n', '      the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to\\n', '      her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the\\n', '      contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\\n', '      wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have\\n', '      loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.\\n', '\\n', '      But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.\\n', '      Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all,\\n', '      soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with\\n', '      her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;\\n', '      and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a\\n', '      sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a\\n', '      manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise\\n', '      restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been long desiring my\\n', '      absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but\\n', '      real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\\n', '      could be either said or done on my part that might offer\\n', '      consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with\\n', '      vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\\n', '      This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having\\n', '      the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say\\n', '      that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the\\n', '      unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be\\n', '      long.”\\n', '\\n', '      He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow\\n', '      for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was\\n', '      at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her\\n', '      relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.\\n', '\\n', '      As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that\\n', '      they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality\\n', '      as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she\\n', '      threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their\\n', '      acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at\\n', '      the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted\\n', '      its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its\\n', '      termination.\\n', '\\n', '      If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,\\n', '      Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor\\n', '      faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is\\n', '      unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often\\n', '      described as arising on a first interview with its object, and\\n', '      even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in\\n', '      her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the\\n', '      latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill\\n', '      success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less\\n', '      interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\\n', '      with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy\\n', '      must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that\\n', '      wretched business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had\\n', '      she entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one\\n', '      but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an\\n', '      expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this\\n', '      development. While the contents of the first letter remained in\\n', '      her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham\\n', '      should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for\\n', '      money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\\n', '      incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an\\n', '      attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though\\n', '      she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an\\n', '      elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no\\n', '      difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her\\n', '      understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\\n', '\\n', '      She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,\\n', '      that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that\\n', '      Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.\\n', '      Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite,\\n', '      as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections\\n', '      had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The\\n', '      mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a\\n', '      girl—oh! how acutely did she now feel it!\\n', '\\n', '      She was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot\\n', '      to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon\\n', '      her, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable\\n', '      of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost\\n', '      persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s\\n', '      interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered\\n', '      the room her impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had\\n', '      hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that\\n', '      their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly\\n', '      on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\\n', '      summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the\\n', '      postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had\\n', '      never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not\\n', '      but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned\\n', '      in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth,\\n', '      though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude;\\n', '      and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating\\n', '      to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as\\n', '      soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?” cried\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\\n', '      us; was it so?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our\\n', '      engagement. _That_ is all settled.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is all settled;” repeated the other, as she ran into her\\n', '      room to prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to\\n', '      disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\\n', '\\n', '      But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her\\n', '      in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth\\n', '      been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that\\n', '      all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but\\n', '      she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst\\n', '      the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at\\n', '      Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,\\n', '      however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile\\n', '      having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be\\n', '      done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the\\n', '      morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\\n', '      have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to\\n', '      Longbourn.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 47\\n', '\\n', '      “I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle,\\n', '      as they drove from the town; “and really, upon serious\\n', '      consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as\\n', '      your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very\\n', '      unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a\\n', '      girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was\\n', '      actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I am strongly\\n', '      inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would\\n', '      not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\\n', '      regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His\\n', '      temptation is not adequate to the risk!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a\\n', '      moment.\\n', '\\n', '      “Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your\\n', '      uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,\\n', '      honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so\\n', '      very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him\\n', '      up, as to believe him capable of it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\\n', '      neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so!\\n', '      But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if\\n', '      that had been the case?”\\n', '\\n', '      “In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute\\n', '      proof that they are not gone to Scotland.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is\\n', '      such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be\\n', '      found on the Barnet road.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there,\\n', '      though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional\\n', '      purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on\\n', '      either side; and it might strike them that they could be more\\n', '      economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than\\n', '      in Scotland.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must\\n', '      their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His\\n', '      most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded\\n', '      of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a\\n', '      woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims\\n', '      has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good\\n', '      humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of\\n', '      benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the\\n', '      apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\\n', '      dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I\\n', '      know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But\\n', '      as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.\\n', '      Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from\\n', '      my father’s behaviour, from his indolence and the little\\n', '      attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in\\n', '      his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little\\n', '      about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love\\n', '      of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than\\n', '      marriage?”\\n', '\\n', '      “It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied\\n', '      Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of\\n', '      decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,\\n', '      really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her\\n', '      justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to\\n', '      think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a\\n', '      twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and\\n', '      vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most\\n', '      idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in\\n', '      her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton,\\n', '      nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head.\\n', '      She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and\\n', '      talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?\\n', '      susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively\\n', '      enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person\\n', '      and address that can captivate a woman.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very\\n', '      ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever\\n', '      might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of\\n', '      such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane\\n', '      knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that\\n', '      he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has\\n', '      neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful\\n', '      as he is insinuating.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose\\n', '      curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\\n', '\\n', '      “I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the\\n', '      other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you\\n', '      yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke\\n', '      of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality\\n', '      towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at\\n', '      liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about\\n', '      the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss\\n', '      Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,\\n', '      disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must\\n', '      know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\\n', '      her.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what\\n', '      you and Jane seem so well to understand?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and\\n', '      saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel\\n', '      Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I\\n', '      returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or\\n', '      fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I\\n', '      related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our\\n', '      knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any\\n', '      one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him\\n', '      should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that\\n', '      Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her\\n', '      eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\\n', '      in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such\\n', '      a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was\\n', '      far enough from my thoughts.”\\n', '\\n', '      “When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,\\n', '      I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on\\n', '      either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you\\n', '      must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be\\n', '      thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready\\n', '      enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near\\n', '      Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months;\\n', '      but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention;\\n', '      and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\\n', '      wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the\\n', '      regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her\\n', '      favourites.”\\n', '\\n', '      It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could\\n', '      be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this\\n', '      interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could\\n', '      detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From\\n', '      Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the\\n', '      keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval\\n', '      of ease or forgetfulness.\\n', '\\n', '      They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one\\n', '      night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.\\n', '      It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not\\n', '      have been wearied by long expectations.\\n', '\\n', '      The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were\\n', '      standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;\\n', '      and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise\\n', '      that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their\\n', '      whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first\\n', '      pleasing earnest of their welcome.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty\\n', '      kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running\\n', '      down from her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears\\n', '      filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether\\n', '      anything had been heard of the fugitives.\\n', '\\n', '      “Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I\\n', '      hope everything will be well.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Is my father in town?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And have you heard from him often?”\\n', '\\n', '      “We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday\\n', '      to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his\\n', '      directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely\\n', '      added that he should not write again till he had something of\\n', '      importance to mention.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And my mother—how is she? How are you all?”\\n', '\\n', '      “My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are\\n', '      greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction\\n', '      in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary\\n', '      and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But you—how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much\\n', '      you must have gone through!”\\n', '\\n', '      Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and\\n', '      their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to\\n', '      by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and\\n', '      aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles\\n', '      and tears.\\n', '\\n', '      When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which\\n', '      Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the\\n', '      others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to\\n', '      give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence\\n', '      of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still\\n', '      expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would\\n', '      bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain\\n', '      their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few\\n', '      minutes’ conversation together, received them exactly as might be\\n', '      expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives\\n', '      against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her\\n', '      own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to\\n', '      whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must\\n', '      principally be owing.\\n', '\\n', '      “If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to\\n', '      Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but\\n', '      poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the\\n', '      Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was\\n', '      some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the\\n', '      kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked\\n', '      after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge\\n', '      of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And\\n', '      now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\\n', '      Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and\\n', '      what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out\\n', '      before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us,\\n', '      brother, I do not know what we shall do.”\\n', '\\n', '      They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,\\n', '      after general assurances of his affection for her and all her\\n', '      family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day,\\n', '      and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering\\n', '      Lydia.\\n', '\\n', '      “Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right\\n', '      to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it\\n', '      as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a\\n', '      few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know\\n', '      that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not\\n', '      let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I\\n', '      shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to\\n', '      Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what\\n', '      is to be done.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what\\n', '      I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find\\n', '      them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married\\n', '      already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not\\n', '      let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much\\n', '      money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And,\\n', '      above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a\\n', '      dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and\\n', '      have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms\\n', '      in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that\\n', '      I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not\\n', '      to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\\n', '      for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,\\n', '      how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\\n', '\\n', '      But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest\\n', '      endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation\\n', '      to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with\\n', '      her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left\\n', '      her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in\\n', '      the absence of her daughters.\\n', '\\n', '      Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no\\n', '      real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not\\n', '      attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence\\n', '      enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited\\n', '      at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household,\\n', '      and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her\\n', '      fears and solicitude on the subject.\\n', '\\n', '      In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who\\n', '      had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make\\n', '      their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other\\n', '      from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably\\n', '      calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss\\n', '      of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself\\n', '      incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than\\n', '      usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress\\n', '      enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of\\n', '      grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:\\n', '\\n', '      “This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much\\n', '      talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the\\n', '      wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”\\n', '\\n', '      Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she\\n', '      added, “Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from\\n', '      it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is\\n', '      irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin;\\n', '      that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and\\n', '      that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the\\n', '      undeserving of the other sex.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much\\n', '      oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console\\n', '      herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before\\n', '      them.\\n', '\\n', '      In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for\\n', '      half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed\\n', '      herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane\\n', '      was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general\\n', '      lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which\\n', '      Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could\\n', '      not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the\\n', '      subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it\\n', '      which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What\\n', '      did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything\\n', '      before the elopement took place? They must have seen them\\n', '      together for ever.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some\\n', '      partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him\\n', '      any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive\\n', '      and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure\\n', '      us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone\\n', '      to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened\\n', '      his journey.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he\\n', '      know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny\\n', '      himself?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing\\n', '      anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion\\n', '      about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not\\n', '      marrying—and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have\\n', '      been misunderstood before.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you\\n', '      entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”\\n', '\\n', '      “How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I\\n', '      felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness\\n', '      with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not\\n', '      been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of\\n', '      that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then\\n', '      owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest\\n', '      of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she had prepared her for such\\n', '      a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each\\n', '      other, many weeks.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But not before they went to Brighton?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, I believe not.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?\\n', '      Does he know his real character?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he\\n', '      formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.\\n', '      And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he\\n', '      left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of\\n', '      him, this could not have happened!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to\\n', '      expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their\\n', '      present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the\\n', '      best intentions.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to\\n', '      his wife?”\\n', '\\n', '      “He brought it with him for us to see.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.\\n', '      These were the contents:\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Harriet,\\n', '      “You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\\n', '      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I\\n', '      am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess\\n', '      with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man\\n', '      in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy\\n', '      without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send\\n', '      them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it\\n', '      will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign\\n', '      my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a good joke it will be! I can\\n', '      hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not\\n', '      keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I\\n', '      hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will\\n', '      dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I\\n', '      shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you\\n', '      would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown\\n', '      before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel\\n', '      Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.\\n', '\\n', '      “Your affectionate friend,\\n', '      “LYDIA BENNET.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she\\n', '      had finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a\\n', '      moment! But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the\\n', '      subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade\\n', '      her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor\\n', '      father! how he must have felt it!”\\n', '\\n', '      “I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for\\n', '      full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the\\n', '      whole house in such confusion!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it\\n', '      who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a\\n', '      time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I\\n', '      endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid\\n', '      I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what\\n', '      might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not\\n', '      look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care\\n', '      and anxiety upon yourself alone.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in\\n', '      every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either\\n', '      of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,\\n', '      that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt\\n', '      Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away;\\n', '      and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of\\n', '      great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very\\n', '      kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us,\\n', '      and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if they\\n', '      should be of use to us.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps\\n', '      she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one\\n', '      cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is\\n', '      impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at\\n', '      a distance, and be satisfied.”\\n', '\\n', '      She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father\\n', '      had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his\\n', '      daughter.\\n', '\\n', '      “He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place\\n', '      where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if\\n', '      anything could be made out from them. His principal object must\\n', '      be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them\\n', '      from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he\\n', '      thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing\\n', '      from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make\\n', '      enquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house\\n', '      the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make\\n', '      enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out\\n', '      the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other\\n', '      designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be\\n', '      gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had\\n', '      difficulty in finding out even so much as this.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 48\\n', '\\n', '      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the\\n', '      next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line\\n', '      from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a\\n', '      most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time\\n', '      they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he\\n', '      had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they\\n', '      would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only\\n', '      for the letters before he set off.\\n', '\\n', '      When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving\\n', '      constant information of what was going on, and their uncle\\n', '      promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to\\n', '      Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his\\n', '      sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband’s\\n', '      not being killed in a duel.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a\\n', '      few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be\\n', '      serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of\\n', '      freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and\\n', '      always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening\\n', '      them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh\\n', '      instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she seldom\\n', '      went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found\\n', '      them.\\n', '\\n', '      All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three\\n', '      months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared\\n', '      to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues,\\n', '      all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into\\n', '      every tradesman’s family. Everybody declared that he was the\\n', '      wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out\\n', '      that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.\\n', '      Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said,\\n', '      believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister’s ruin\\n', '      more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,\\n', '      became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come\\n', '      when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before\\n', '      entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained\\n', '      some news of them.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife\\n', '      received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he\\n', '      had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come\\n', '      to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and\\n', '      Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory\\n', '      information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the\\n', '      principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they\\n', '      might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,\\n', '      before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not\\n', '      expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was\\n', '      eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that\\n', '      Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London\\n', '      and promised to write again very soon. There was also a\\n', '      postscript to this effect:\\n', '\\n', '      “I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if\\n', '      possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,\\n', '      whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be\\n', '      likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself.\\n', '      If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability\\n', '      of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential\\n', '      consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel\\n', '      Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy\\n', '      us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could\\n', '      tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other\\n', '      person.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference\\n', '      to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give\\n', '      any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment\\n', '      deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations,\\n', '      except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many\\n', '      years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in\\n', '      the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though\\n', '      she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a\\n', '      something to look forward to.\\n', '\\n', '      Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most\\n', '      anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival\\n', '      of letters was the grand object of every morning’s impatience.\\n', '      Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be\\n', '      communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some\\n', '      news of importance.\\n', '\\n', '      But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived\\n', '      for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;\\n', '      which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for\\n', '      him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew\\n', '      what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and\\n', '      read it likewise. It was as follows:\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Sir,\\n', '      “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\\n', '      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are\\n', '      now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a\\n', '      letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.\\n', '      Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your\\n', '      respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of\\n', '      the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time\\n', '      can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can\\n', '      alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a\\n', '      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a\\n', '      parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a\\n', '      blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be\\n', '      lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\\n', '      informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your\\n', '      daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;\\n', '      though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must\\n', '      be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity,\\n', '      at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to\\n', '      be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,\\n', '      but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have\\n', '      related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this\\n', '      false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\\n', '      all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself\\n', '      condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?\\n', '      And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with\\n', '      augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for\\n', '      had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your\\n', '      sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console\\n', '      yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\\n', '      from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of\\n', '      her own heinous offense.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer\\n', '      from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant\\n', '      nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single\\n', '      relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was\\n', '      certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances\\n', '      had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did\\n', '      not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any\\n', '      of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as\\n', '      likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his\\n', '      own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in\\n', '      addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for it\\n', '      had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\\n', '      very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than\\n', '      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at\\n', '      Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour\\n', '      were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to\\n', '      conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard\\n', '      them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly\\n', '      unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see\\n', '      their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.\\n', '      Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,\\n', '      he had yielded to his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would\\n', '      return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion\\n', '      might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much\\n', '      satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her\\n', '      anxiety for his life had been before.\\n', '\\n', '      “What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried.\\n', '      “Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is\\n', '      to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?”\\n', '\\n', '      As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that\\n', '      she and the children should go to London, at the same time that\\n', '      Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the\\n', '      first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to\\n', '      Longbourn.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and\\n', '      her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the\\n', '      world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them\\n', '      by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from\\n', '      him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her\\n', '      return that could come from Pemberley.\\n', '\\n', '      The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse\\n', '      for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,\\n', '      could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who\\n', '      was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings,\\n', '      was perfectly aware that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she\\n', '      could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It\\n', '      would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of\\n', '      two.\\n', '\\n', '      When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual\\n', '      philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in\\n', '      the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had\\n', '      taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had\\n', '      courage to speak of it.\\n', '\\n', '      It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea,\\n', '      that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on\\n', '      her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured,\\n', '      he replied, “Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?\\n', '      It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so\\n', '      prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how\\n', '      much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered\\n', '      by the impression. It will pass away soon enough.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Do you suppose them to be in London?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”\\n', '\\n', '      “And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.\\n', '\\n', '      “She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence\\n', '      there will probably be of some duration.”\\n', '\\n', '      Then after a short silence he continued:\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice\\n', '      to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some\\n', '      greatness of mind.”\\n', '\\n', '      They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her\\n', '      mother’s tea.\\n', '\\n', '      “This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such\\n', '      an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will\\n', '      sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as\\n', '      much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty\\n', '      runs away.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If _I_\\n', '      should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as\\n', '      Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to\\n', '      be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is\\n', '      ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the\\n', '      village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up\\n', '      with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors\\n', '      till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day\\n', '      in a rational manner.”\\n', '\\n', '      Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to\\n', '      cry.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are\\n', '      a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review\\n', '      at the end of them.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 49\\n', '\\n', '      Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were\\n', '      walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the\\n', '      housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to\\n', '      call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead\\n', '      of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to\\n', '      Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but\\n', '      I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I\\n', '      took the liberty of coming to ask.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you\\n', '      know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He\\n', '      has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter.”\\n', '\\n', '      Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.\\n', '      They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from\\n', '      thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were\\n', '      on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when\\n', '      they were met by the butler, who said:\\n', '\\n', '      “If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards\\n', '      the little copse.”\\n', '\\n', '      Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall\\n', '      once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was\\n', '      deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of\\n', '      the paddock.\\n', '\\n', '      Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as\\n', '      Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for\\n', '      breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?”\\n', '\\n', '      “What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the\\n', '      letter from his pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.\\n', '\\n', '      “Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself\\n', '      what it is about.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2.\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Brother,\\n', '      “At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such\\n', '      as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon\\n', '      after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out\\n', '      in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till\\n', '      we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen\\n', '      them both—”\\n', '          “Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are\\n', '          married!”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth read on:\\n', '\\n', '      “I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find\\n', '      there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to\\n', '      perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your\\n', '      side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\\n', '      required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,\\n', '      her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your\\n', '      children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\\n', '      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during\\n', '      your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions\\n', '      which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying\\n', '      with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall\\n', '      send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me\\n', '      your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,\\n', '      that Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are\\n', '      generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that\\n', '      respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,\\n', '      even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in\\n', '      addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,\\n', '      you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole\\n', '      of this business, I will immediately give directions to\\n', '      Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.

We have judged it best that my niece should be\\n', '      married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She\\n', '      comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more\\n', '      is determined on. Yours, etc.,\\n', '\\n', '      “EDW. GARDINER.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it\\n', '      be possible that he will marry her?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said\\n', '      her sister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “No; but it must be done soon.”\\n', '\\n', '      Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time\\n', '      before he wrote.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write\\n', '      immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a\\n', '      case.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble\\n', '      yourself.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”\\n', '\\n', '      And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the\\n', '      house.\\n', '\\n', '      “And may I ask—” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must\\n', '      be complied with.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But\\n', '      there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how\\n', '      much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the\\n', '      other, how am I ever to pay him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight\\n', '      a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty\\n', '      after I am gone.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred\\n', '      to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to\\n', '      remain! Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I\\n', '      am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all\\n', '      this.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a\\n', '      farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to\\n', '      think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be\\n', '      repaid?”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,\\n', '      continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then\\n', '      went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the\\n', '      breakfast-room.\\n', '\\n', '      “And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as\\n', '      they were by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we\\n', '      are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their\\n', '      chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are\\n', '      forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”\\n', '\\n', '      “I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he\\n', '      certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for\\n', '      her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing\\n', '      him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like\\n', '      it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have\\n', '      more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?”\\n', '\\n', '      “If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,”\\n', '      said Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our\\n', '      sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for\\n', '      them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness\\n', '      of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her\\n', '      home, and affording her their personal protection and\\n', '      countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of\\n', '      gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually\\n', '      with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she\\n', '      will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she\\n', '      first sees my aunt!”\\n', '\\n', '      “We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,”\\n', '      said Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His\\n', '      consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is\\n', '      come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will\\n', '      steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,\\n', '      and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past\\n', '      imprudence forgotten.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither\\n', '      you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of\\n', '      it.”\\n', '\\n', '      It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all\\n', '      likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to\\n', '      the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would\\n', '      not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and,\\n', '      without raising his head, coolly replied:\\n', '\\n', '      “Just as you please.”\\n', '\\n', '      “May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Take whatever you like, and get away.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went\\n', '      up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:\\n', '      one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight\\n', '      preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet\\n', '      could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.\\n', '      Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her joy burst\\n', '      forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She\\n', '      was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever\\n', '      been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\\n', '      would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\\n', '      felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She\\n', '      will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at\\n', '      sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he\\n', '      would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear\\n', '      Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write\\n', '      to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run\\n', '      down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay,\\n', '      stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will\\n', '      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we\\n', '      shall be together when we meet!”\\n', '\\n', '      Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the\\n', '      violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the\\n', '      obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.\\n', '\\n', '      “For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a\\n', '      great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has\\n', '      pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it\\n', '      but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and\\n', '      my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the\\n', '      first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few\\n', '      presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a\\n', '      daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was\\n', '      only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,\\n', '      that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write\\n', '      for me. We will settle with your father about the money\\n', '      afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”\\n', '\\n', '      She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,\\n', '      and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful\\n', '      orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her\\n', '      to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s\\n', '      delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother\\n', '      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,\\n', '      too, came into her head.\\n', '\\n', '      “I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and\\n', '      tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come\\n', '      back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and\\n', '      order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I\\n', '      am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here\\n', '      comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss\\n', '      Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of\\n', '      punch to make merry at her wedding.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received\\n', '      her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this\\n', '      folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with\\n', '      freedom.\\n', '\\n', '      Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it\\n', '      was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and\\n', '      though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor\\n', '      worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in\\n', '      looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she\\n', '      felt all the advantages of what they had gained.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 50\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life\\n', '      that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an\\n', '      annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his\\n', '      wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had\\n', '      he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been\\n', '      indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now\\n', '      be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of\\n', '      the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband\\n', '      might then have rested in its proper place.\\n', '\\n', '      He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to\\n', '      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his\\n', '      brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out\\n', '      the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as\\n', '      soon as he could.\\n', '\\n', '      When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be\\n', '      perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The\\n', '      son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should\\n', '      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means\\n', '      be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,\\n', '      but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years\\n', '      after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he would. This event\\n', '      had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be\\n', '      saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband’s\\n', '      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\\n', '      income.\\n', '\\n', '      Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be\\n', '      divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.\\n', '      This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now\\n', '      to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in\\n', '      acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful\\n', '      acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed\\n', '      most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\\n', '      approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil\\n', '      the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before\\n', '      supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his\\n', '      daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to\\n', '      himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten\\n', '      pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;\\n', '      for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual\\n', '      presents in money which passed to her through her mother’s hands,\\n', '      Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.\\n', '\\n', '      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side,\\n', '      too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present\\n', '      was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When\\n', '      the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in\\n', '      seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former\\n', '      indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory\\n', '      in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged\\n', '      to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his\\n', '      brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.\\n', '\\n', '      The good news spread quickly through the house, and with\\n', '      proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in\\n', '      the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been\\n', '      more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come\\n', '      upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded\\n', '      from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to\\n', '      be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her\\n', '      well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old\\n', '      ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this\\n', '      change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery\\n', '      was considered certain.\\n', '\\n', '      It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on\\n', '      this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table,\\n', '      and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a\\n', '      damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been\\n', '      the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on\\n', '      the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran\\n', '      wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new\\n', '      carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the\\n', '      neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and,\\n', '      without knowing or considering what their income might be,\\n', '      rejected many as deficient in size and importance.\\n', '\\n', '      “Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit\\n', '      it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;\\n', '      but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten\\n', '      miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\\n', '\\n', '      Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\\n', '      servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her:\\n', '      “Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your\\n', '      son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into\\n', '      _one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have\\n', '      admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by\\n', '      receiving them at Longbourn.”\\n', '\\n', '      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was\\n', '      firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with\\n', '      amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea\\n', '      to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should\\n', '      receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be\\n', '      carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse\\n', '      his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would\\n', '      scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She\\n', '      was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must\\n', '      reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at\\n', '      her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took\\n', '      place.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the\\n', '      distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted\\n', '      with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so\\n', '      shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might\\n', '      hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who\\n', '      were not immediately on the spot.\\n', '\\n', '      She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There\\n', '      were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently\\n', '      depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge\\n', '      of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her so much—not,\\n', '      however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to\\n', '      herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between\\n', '      them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable\\n', '      terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect\\n', '      himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now\\n', '      be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a\\n', '      man whom he so justly scorned.\\n', '\\n', '      From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink.\\n', '      The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself\\n', '      of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation\\n', '      survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved;\\n', '      she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous\\n', '      of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by\\n', '      it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance\\n', '      of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have\\n', '      been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should\\n', '      meet.\\n', '\\n', '      What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that\\n', '      the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago,\\n', '      would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was\\n', '      as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex;\\n', '      but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.\\n', '\\n', '      She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\\n', '      disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding\\n', '      and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her\\n', '      wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of\\n', '      both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been\\n', '      softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement,\\n', '      information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received\\n', '      benefit of greater importance.\\n', '\\n', '      But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude\\n', '      what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different\\n', '      tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon\\n', '      to be formed in their family.\\n', '\\n', '      How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable\\n', '      independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent\\n', '      happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together\\n', '      because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could\\n', '      easily conjecture.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\\n', '      acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his\\n', '      eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and\\n', '      concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be\\n', '      mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was\\n', '      to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the\\n', '      militia.\\n', '\\n', '      “It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon\\n', '      as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,\\n', '      in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,\\n', '      both on his account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention\\n', '      to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are\\n', '      still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He\\n', '      has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——’s regiment, now\\n', '      quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from\\n', '      this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among\\n', '      different people, where they may each have a character to\\n', '      preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to\\n', '      Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and\\n', '      to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.\\n', '      Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,\\n', '      for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the\\n', '      trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in\\n', '      Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his\\n', '      information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he\\n', '      has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will\\n', '      be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless\\n', '      they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before\\n', '      she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully\\n', '      remembered to you and her mother.—Yours, etc.,\\n', '\\n', '      “E. GARDINER.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s\\n', '      removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being\\n', '      settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure\\n', '      and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her\\n', '      plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe\\n', '      disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia\\n', '      should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with\\n', '      everybody, and had so many favourites.\\n', '\\n', '      “She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite\\n', '      shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young\\n', '      men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so\\n', '      pleasant in General ——’s regiment.”\\n', '\\n', '      His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being\\n', '      admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,\\n', '      received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,\\n', '      who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings\\n', '      and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by\\n', '      her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so\\n', '      mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as\\n', '      they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they\\n', '      thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the\\n', '      satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her\\n', '      married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to\\n', '      the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore,\\n', '      he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that\\n', '      as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to\\n', '      Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should\\n', '      consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own\\n', '      inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object\\n', '      of her wishes.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 51\\n', '\\n', '      Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt\\n', '      for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was\\n', '      sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by\\n', '      dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,\\n', '      and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would\\n', '      have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was\\n', '      wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.\\n', '\\n', '      They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to\\n', '      receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the\\n', '      carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably\\n', '      grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.\\n', '\\n', '      Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown\\n', '      open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards,\\n', '      embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with\\n', '      an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and\\n', '      wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of\\n', '      their happiness.\\n', '\\n', '      Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was\\n', '      not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity;\\n', '      and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young\\n', '      couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was\\n', '      disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia\\n', '      still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\\n', '      from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when\\n', '      at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took\\n', '      notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a\\n', '      laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.\\n', '\\n', '      Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his\\n', '      manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his\\n', '      marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy\\n', '      address, while he claimed their relationship, would have\\n', '      delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite\\n', '      equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within\\n', '      herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an\\n', '      impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of\\n', '      the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\\n', '      colour.\\n', '\\n', '      There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could\\n', '      neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to\\n', '      sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in\\n', '      that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very\\n', '      unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have\\n', '      the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was\\n', '      recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects\\n', '      which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.\\n', '\\n', '      “Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went\\n', '      away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been\\n', '      things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went\\n', '      away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came\\n', '      back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was.”\\n', '\\n', '      Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth\\n', '      looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw\\n', '      anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,\\n', '      “Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I\\n', '      was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in\\n', '      his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let\\n', '      down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let\\n', '      my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the\\n', '      ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the\\n', '      room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through\\n', '      the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough\\n', '      to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right\\n', '      hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take\\n', '      your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married\\n', '      woman.”\\n', '\\n', '      It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that\\n', '      embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first.\\n', '      Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs.\\n', '      Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to\\n', '      hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by each of them; and in the\\n', '      mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of\\n', '      being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the\\n', '      breakfast room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a\\n', '      charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope\\n', '      they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.\\n', '      That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we\\n', '      did not all go.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I\\n', '      don’t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\\n', '      things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.\\n', '      We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there\\n', '      will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for\\n', '      them all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.\\n', '\\n', '      “And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my\\n', '      sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them\\n', '      before the winter is over.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I\\n', '      do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.”\\n', '\\n', '      Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.\\n', '      Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he\\n', '      was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.\\n', '\\n', '      No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so\\n', '      short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with\\n', '      her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These\\n', '      parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even\\n', '      more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.\\n', '\\n', '      Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had\\n', '      expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had\\n', '      scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the\\n', '      reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the\\n', '      strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have\\n', '      wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope\\n', '      with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was\\n', '      rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were\\n', '      the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of\\n', '      having a companion.\\n', '\\n', '      Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on\\n', '      every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He\\n', '      did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill\\n', '      more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the\\n', '      country.\\n', '\\n', '      One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with\\n', '      her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.\\n', '      You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.\\n', '      Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too\\n', '      little said on the subject.”\\n', '\\n', '      “La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We\\n', '      were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s\\n', '      lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should\\n', '      all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to\\n', '      go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,\\n', '      Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\\n', '      you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I\\n', '      should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the\\n', '      time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she\\n', '      was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\\n', '      ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I\\n', '      longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would\\n', '      never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my\\n', '      uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with\\n', '      them. If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of\\n', '      doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,\\n', '      or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the\\n', '      Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came\\n', '      to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that\\n', '      horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get\\n', '      together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did\\n', '      not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\\n', '      were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,\\n', '      luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all\\n', '      set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been\\n', '      prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy\\n', '      might have done as well.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But\\n', '      gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word\\n', '      about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?\\n', '      It was to be such a secret!”\\n', '\\n', '      “If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\\n', '      subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;\\n', '      “we will ask you no questions.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell\\n', '      you all, and then Wickham would be angry.”\\n', '\\n', '      On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out\\n', '      of her power, by running away.\\n', '\\n', '      But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at\\n', '      least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had\\n', '      been at her sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly\\n', '      among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least\\n', '      temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and\\n', '      wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.\\n', '      Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the\\n', '      noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such\\n', '      suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short\\n', '      letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had\\n', '      dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\\n', '      intended.\\n', '\\n', '      “You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must\\n', '      be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and\\n', '      (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have\\n', '      been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me\\n', '      understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in\\n', '      the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must\\n', '      endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she\\n', '      finished the letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in\\n', '      an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and\\n', '      stratagems to find it out.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to\\n', '      Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was\\n', '      glad of it;—till it appeared whether her enquiries would receive\\n', '      any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 52\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her\\n', '      letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in\\n', '      possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she\\n', '      was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the\\n', '      benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter\\n', '      convinced her that it did not contain a denial.\\n', '\\n', '      “Gracechurch Street, _Sept_. 6.\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Niece,\\n', '\\n', '      “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\\n', '      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing\\n', '      will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\\n', '      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\\n', '      Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know\\n', '      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\\n', '      side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\\n', '      impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing\\n', '      but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\\n', '      him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\\n', '      ignorant, I must be more explicit.\\n', '\\n', '      “On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had\\n', '      a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with\\n', '      him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my\\n', '      curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have\\n', '      been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where\\n', '      your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked\\n', '      with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can\\n', '      collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and\\n', '      came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive\\n', '      professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that\\n', '      Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it\\n', '      impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in\\n', '      him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\\n', '      confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his\\n', '      private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for\\n', '      itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and\\n', '      endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.\\n', '      If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace\\n', '      him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\\n', '      discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which\\n', '      was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\\n', '      reason for his resolving to follow us.\\n', '\\n', '      “There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\\n', '      governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on\\n', '      some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She\\n', '      then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since\\n', '      maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he\\n', '      knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for\\n', '      intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or\\n', '      three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would\\n', '      not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,\\n', '      for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham\\n', '      indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\\n', '      she been able to receive them into her house, they would have\\n', '      taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind\\n', '      friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street.\\n', '      He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His\\n', '      first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her\\n', '      to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\\n', '      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\\n', '      offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found\\n', '      Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\\n', '      for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not\\n', '      hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some\\n', '      time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were\\n', '      her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and\\n', '      expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with\\n', '      Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He\\n', '      confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of\\n', '      some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not\\n', '      to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own\\n', '      folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and\\n', '      as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about\\n', '      it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew\\n', '      he should have nothing to live on.\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.\\n', '      Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\\n', '      been able to do something for him, and his situation must have\\n', '      been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this\\n', '      question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\\n', '      effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country.\\n', '      Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\\n', '      against the temptation of immediate relief.\\n', '\\n', '      “They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.\\n', '      Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length\\n', '      was reduced to be reasonable.\\n', '\\n', '      “Everything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step\\n', '      was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\\n', '      Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.\\n', '      Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further\\n', '      enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town\\n', '      the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person\\n', '      whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore\\n', '      readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the\\n', '      former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was\\n', '      only known that a gentleman had called on business.\\n', '\\n', '      “On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at\\n', '      home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\\n', '      together.\\n', '\\n', '      “They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not\\n', '      all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was\\n', '      sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\\n', '      fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\\n', '      after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times,\\n', '      but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did\\n', '      not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be\\n', '      thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most\\n', '      readily have settled the whole.\\n', '\\n', '      “They battled it together for a long time, which was more than\\n', '      either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at\\n', '      last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed\\n', '      to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having\\n', '      the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;\\n', '      and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great\\n', '      pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him\\n', '      of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.\\n', '      But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at\\n', '      most.\\n', '\\n', '      “You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the\\n', '      young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to\\n', '      considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in\\n', '      addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission\\n', '      purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone,\\n', '      was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\\n', '      reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s\\n', '      character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had\\n', '      been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\\n', '      in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\\n', '      reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all\\n', '      this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured\\n', '      that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him\\n', '      credit for _another interest_ in the affair.\\n', '\\n', '      “When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends,\\n', '      who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he\\n', '      should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and\\n', '      all money matters were then to receive the last finish.\\n', '\\n', '      “I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation\\n', '      which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least\\n', '      it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and\\n', '      Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly\\n', '      what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would\\n', '      not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\\n', '      while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\\n', '      last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\\n', '      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\\n', '      fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious\\n', '      manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\\n', '      done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If\\n', '      she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not\\n', '      listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my\\n', '      dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with\\n', '      her.\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,\\n', '      attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to\\n', '      leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry\\n', '      with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying\\n', '      (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.\\n', '      His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as\\n', '      when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all\\n', '      please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and\\n', '      _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I\\n', '      thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But\\n', '      slyness seems the fashion.\\n', '\\n', '      “Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do\\n', '      not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be\\n', '      quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,\\n', '      with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.\\n', '\\n', '      “But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this\\n', '      half hour.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yours, very sincerely,\\n', '      “M. GARDINER.”\\n', '\\n', '      The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of\\n', '      spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure\\n', '      or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled\\n', '      suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might\\n', '      have been doing to forward her sister’s match, which she had\\n', '      feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be\\n', '      probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain\\n', '      of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be\\n', '      true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on\\n', '      himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\\n', '      research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman\\n', '      whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to\\n', '      meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,\\n', '      the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name\\n', '      it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a\\n', '      girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did\\n', '      whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\\n', '      checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her\\n', '      vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection\\n', '      for her—for a woman who had already refused him—as able to\\n', '      overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against\\n', '      relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind\\n', '      of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure,\\n', '      done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a\\n', '      reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch\\n', '      of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\\n', '      wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it;\\n', '      and though she would not place herself as his principal\\n', '      inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality\\n', '      for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of\\n', '      mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly\\n', '      painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who\\n', '      could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,\\n', '      her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she\\n', '      grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged,\\n', '      every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself\\n', '      she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\\n', '      of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of\\n', '      himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\\n', '      again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even\\n', '      sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding\\n', '      how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that\\n', '      affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.\\n', '\\n', '      She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s\\n', '      approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was\\n', '      overtaken by Wickham.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?”\\n', '      said he, as he joined her.\\n', '\\n', '      “You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not\\n', '      follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good\\n', '      friends; and now we are better.”\\n', '\\n', '      “True. Are the others coming out?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage\\n', '      to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and\\n', '      aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.”\\n', '\\n', '      She replied in the affirmative.\\n', '\\n', '      “I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be\\n', '      too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.\\n', '      And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she\\n', '      was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my\\n', '      name to you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, she did.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And what did she say?”\\n', '\\n', '      “That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not\\n', '      turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things\\n', '      are strangely misrepresented.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\\n', '      silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\\n', '\\n', '      “I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each\\n', '      other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said\\n', '      Elizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at\\n', '      this time of year.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I\\n', '      thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And do you like her?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Very much.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within\\n', '      this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very\\n', '      promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out\\n', '      well.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Did you go by the village of Kympton?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not recollect that we did.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have\\n', '      had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would\\n', '      have suited me in every respect.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How should you have liked making sermons?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my\\n', '      duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought\\n', '      not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing\\n', '      for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have\\n', '      answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you\\n', '      ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that\\n', '      it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the\\n', '      present patron.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from\\n', '      the first, you may remember.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was\\n', '      not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you\\n', '      actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and\\n', '      that the business had been compromised accordingly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may\\n', '      remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of\\n', '      it.”\\n', '\\n', '      They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked\\n', '      fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to\\n', '      provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:\\n', '\\n', '      “Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not\\n', '      let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be\\n', '      always of one mind.”\\n', '\\n', '      She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry,\\n', '      though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 53\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation\\n', '      that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear\\n', '      sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was\\n', '      pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.\\n', '\\n', '      The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet\\n', '      was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no\\n', '      means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle,\\n', '      was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Write to me very often, my dear.”\\n', '\\n', '      “As often as I can. But you know married women have never much\\n', '      time for writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have\\n', '      nothing else to do.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s.\\n', '      He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.\\n', '\\n', '      “He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were\\n', '      out of the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and\\n', '      makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even\\n', '      Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”\\n', '\\n', '      The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several\\n', '      days.\\n', '\\n', '      “I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as\\n', '      parting with one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a\\n', '      daughter,” said Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied\\n', '      that your other four are single.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is\\n', '      married, but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so\\n', '      far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so\\n', '      soon.”\\n', '\\n', '      But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was\\n', '      shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of\\n', '      hope, by an article of news which then began to be in\\n', '      circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders\\n', '      to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in\\n', '      a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was\\n', '      quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook\\n', '      her head by turns.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for\\n', '      Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the\\n', '      better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us,\\n', '      you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But,\\n', '      however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes\\n', '      it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.\\n', '      You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word\\n', '      about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”\\n', '\\n', '      “You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was\\n', '      in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself\\n', '      on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was\\n', '      certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very\\n', '      likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher’s, she told me,\\n', '      on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got\\n', '      three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without\\n', '      changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his\\n', '      name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,\\n', '      she said:\\n', '\\n', '      “I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the\\n', '      present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t\\n', '      imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the\\n', '      moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure\\n', '      you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or\\n', '      pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we\\n', '      shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but\\n', '      I dread other people’s remarks.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him\\n', '      in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming\\n', '      there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she\\n', '      still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the\\n', '      greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend’s\\n', '      permission, or being bold enough to come without it.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man\\n', '      cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without\\n', '      raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”\\n', '\\n', '      In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be\\n', '      her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could\\n', '      easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were\\n', '      more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.\\n', '\\n', '      The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their\\n', '      parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\\n', '\\n', '      “As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      “you will wait on him of course.”\\n', '\\n', '      “No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised,\\n', '      if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it\\n', '      ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand\\n', '      again.”\\n', '\\n', '      His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an\\n', '      attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his\\n', '      returning to Netherfield.\\n', '\\n', '      “’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our\\n', '      society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not\\n', '      spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they\\n', '      go away and come back again.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do\\n', '      not wait on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him\\n', '      to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the\\n', '      Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there\\n', '      will be just room at table for him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\\n', '      husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that\\n', '      her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,\\n', '      before _they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,—\\n', '\\n', '      “I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her\\n', '      sister. “It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect\\n', '      indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually\\n', '      talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one\\n', '      can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be,\\n', '      when his stay at Netherfield is over!”\\n', '\\n', '      “I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth;\\n', '      “but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the\\n', '      usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied\\n', '      me, because you have always so much.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of\\n', '      servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the\\n', '      period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as\\n', '      it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their\\n', '      invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on\\n', '      the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw\\n', '      him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride\\n', '      towards the house.\\n', '\\n', '      Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane\\n', '      resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy\\n', '      her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with\\n', '      him, and sat down again by her sister.\\n', '\\n', '      “There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it\\n', '      be?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do\\n', '      not know.”\\n', '\\n', '      “La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be\\n', '      with him before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any\\n', '      friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure;\\n', '      but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but\\n', '      little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the\\n', '      awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost\\n', '      for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both\\n', '      sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and\\n', '      of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her\\n', '      dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only\\n', '      as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either of them.\\n', '      But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\\n', '      suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew\\n', '      Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment\\n', '      towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she\\n', '      had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own\\n', '      more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole\\n', '      family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she\\n', '      regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at\\n', '      least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her\\n', '      astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to\\n', '      Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to\\n', '      what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in\\n', '      Derbyshire.\\n', '\\n', '      The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half\\n', '      a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added\\n', '      lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that\\n', '      his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would\\n', '      not be secure.\\n', '\\n', '      “Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be\\n', '      early enough for expectation.”\\n', '\\n', '      She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without\\n', '      daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them\\n', '      to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the\\n', '      door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than\\n', '      Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her colour\\n', '      increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a\\n', '      propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of\\n', '      resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and\\n', '      sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not\\n', '      often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He\\n', '      looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been\\n', '      used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at\\n', '      Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s presence be\\n', '      what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not\\n', '      an improbable, conjecture.\\n', '\\n', '      Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short\\n', '      period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was\\n', '      received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her\\n', '      two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold\\n', '      and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his\\n', '      friend.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the\\n', '      latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from\\n', '      irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful\\n', '      degree by a distinction so ill applied.\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a\\n', '      question which she could not answer without confusion, said\\n', '      scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the\\n', '      reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.\\n', '      There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself.\\n', '      But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his\\n', '      voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of\\n', '      curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found\\n', '      him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object\\n', '      but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,\\n', '      than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was\\n', '      disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.\\n', '\\n', '      “Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he\\n', '      come?”\\n', '\\n', '      She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;\\n', '      and to him she had hardly courage to speak.\\n', '\\n', '      She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\\n', '\\n', '      “It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet.\\n', '\\n', '      He readily agreed to it.\\n', '\\n', '      “I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People\\n', '      _did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;\\n', '      but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have\\n', '      happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is\\n', '      married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you\\n', '      have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It\\n', '      was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put\\n', '      in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately, George Wickham,\\n', '      Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a syllable said\\n', '      of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was\\n', '      my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\\n', '      make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”\\n', '\\n', '      Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.\\n', '      Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,\\n', '      therefore, she could not tell.\\n', '\\n', '      “It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well\\n', '      married,” continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr.\\n', '      Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.\\n', '      They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it\\n', '      seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His\\n', '      regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving\\n', '      the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank\\n', '      Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he\\n', '      deserves.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such\\n', '      misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew\\n', '      from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else\\n', '      had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he\\n', '      meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he\\n', '      believed.\\n', '\\n', '      “When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her\\n', '      mother, “I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you\\n', '      please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy\\n', '      to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\\n', '      attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had\\n', '      flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would\\n', '      be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,\\n', '      she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself\\n', '      amends for moments of such painful confusion.\\n', '\\n', '      “The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more\\n', '      to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no\\n', '      pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me\\n', '      never see either one or the other again!”\\n', '\\n', '      Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no\\n', '      compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from\\n', '      observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the\\n', '      admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had\\n', '      spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be\\n', '      giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she\\n', '      had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though\\n', '      not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should\\n', '      be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she\\n', '      talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that\\n', '      she did not always know when she was silent.\\n', '\\n', '      When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of\\n', '      her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine\\n', '      at Longbourn in a few days time.\\n', '\\n', '      “You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for\\n', '      when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family\\n', '      dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you\\n', '      see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did\\n', '      not come back and keep your engagement.”\\n', '\\n', '      Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said\\n', '      something of his concern at having been prevented by business.\\n', '      They then went away.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and\\n', '      dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good\\n', '      table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be\\n', '      good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or\\n', '      satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a\\n', '      year.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 54\\n', '\\n', '      As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her\\n', '      spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on\\n', '      those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour\\n', '      astonished and vexed her.\\n', '\\n', '      “Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said\\n', '      she, “did he come at all?”\\n', '\\n', '      She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.\\n', '\\n', '      “He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,\\n', '      when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come\\n', '      hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,\\n', '      teasing, man! I will think no more about him.”\\n', '\\n', '      Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the\\n', '      approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look,\\n', '      which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than\\n', '      Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel\\n', '      perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be\\n', '      embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on\\n', '      Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we\\n', '      meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh,\\n', '      Jane, take care.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger\\n', '      now?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in\\n', '      love with you as ever.”\\n', '\\n', '      They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy\\n', '      schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,\\n', '      in half an hour’s visit, had revived.\\n', '\\n', '      On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and\\n', '      the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their\\n', '      punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they\\n', '      repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see\\n', '      whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former\\n', '      parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother,\\n', '      occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by\\n', '      herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane\\n', '      happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He\\n', '      placed himself by her.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his\\n', '      friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have\\n', '      imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had\\n', '      she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an\\n', '      expression of half-laughing alarm.\\n', '\\n', '      His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as\\n', '      showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than\\n', '      formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,\\n', '      Jane’s happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though\\n', '      she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received\\n', '      pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the\\n', '      animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no\\n', '      cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the\\n', '      table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She\\n', '      knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,\\n', '      or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to\\n', '      hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they\\n', '      spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner\\n', '      whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of\\n', '      what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she\\n', '      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him\\n', '      that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\\n', '      the family.\\n', '\\n', '      She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity\\n', '      of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not\\n', '      pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of\\n', '      conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his\\n', '      entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the\\n', '      drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull\\n', '      to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to\\n', '      their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure\\n', '      for the evening must depend.\\n', '\\n', '      “If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him\\n', '      up for ever.”\\n', '\\n', '      The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\\n', '      answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the\\n', '      table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring\\n', '      out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a\\n', '      single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the\\n', '      gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her\\n', '      than ever, and said, in a whisper:\\n', '\\n', '      “The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none\\n', '      of them; do we?”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed\\n', '      him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely\\n', '      patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged\\n', '      against herself for being so silly!\\n', '\\n', '      “A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish\\n', '      enough to expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the\\n', '      sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second\\n', '      proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to\\n', '      their feelings!”\\n', '\\n', '      She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his\\n', '      coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:\\n', '\\n', '      “Is your sister at Pemberley still?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to\\n', '      Scarborough, these three weeks.”\\n', '\\n', '      She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to\\n', '      converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her,\\n', '      however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young\\n', '      lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.\\n', '\\n', '      When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the\\n', '      ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined\\n', '      by him, when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a\\n', '      victim to her mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few\\n', '      moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost\\n', '      every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening\\n', '      at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his\\n', '      eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room, as to\\n', '      make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\\n', '      supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of\\n', '      the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves,\\n', '      “What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off\\n', '      uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as\\n', '      any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody\\n', '      said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times\\n', '      better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr.\\n', '      Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well\\n', '      done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.\\n', '      And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.\\n', '      Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what\\n', '      do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have\\n', '      her at Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long\\n', '      is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very\\n', '      pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them\\n', '      prodigiously.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen\\n', '      enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she\\n', '      would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her\\n', '      family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that\\n', '      she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next\\n', '      day, to make his proposals.\\n', '\\n', '      “It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to\\n', '      Elizabeth. “The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one\\n', '      with the other. I hope we may often meet again.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth smiled.\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies\\n', '      me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation\\n', '      as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish\\n', '      beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now\\n', '      are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is\\n', '      only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a\\n', '      stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me\\n', '      smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”\\n', '\\n', '      “And how impossible in others!”\\n', '\\n', '      “But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\\n', '      acknowledge?”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all\\n', '      love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth\\n', '      knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not\\n', '      make _me_ your confidante.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 55\\n', '\\n', '      A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.\\n', '      His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to\\n', '      return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and\\n', '      was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine\\n', '      with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed\\n', '      himself engaged elsewhere.\\n', '\\n', '      “Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\\n', '\\n', '      He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if\\n', '      she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of\\n', '      waiting on them.\\n', '\\n', '      “Can you come to-morrow?”\\n', '\\n', '      Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her\\n', '      invitation was accepted with alacrity.\\n', '\\n', '      He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of\\n', '      them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her\\n', '      dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley\\n', '      is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come\\n', '      to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never\\n', '      mind Miss Lizzy’s hair.”\\n', '\\n', '      “We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say\\n', '      Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half\\n', '      an hour ago.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be\\n', '      quick! Where is your sash, my dear?”\\n', '\\n', '      But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to\\n', '      go down without one of her sisters.\\n', '\\n', '      The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in\\n', '      the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was\\n', '      his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two\\n', '      obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking\\n', '      and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,\\n', '      without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not\\n', '      observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently\\n', '      said, “What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me\\n', '      for? What am I to do?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat\\n', '      still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious\\n', '      occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here,\\n', '      my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane\\n', '      instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at\\n', '      such premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in\\n', '      to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and\\n', '      called out:\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was forced to go.\\n', '\\n', '      “We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her\\n', '      mother, as soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up\\n', '      stairs to sit in my dressing-room.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\\n', '      quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then\\n', '      returned into the drawing-room.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\\n', '      every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her\\n', '      daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\\n', '      addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\\n', '      officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with\\n', '      a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to\\n', '      the daughter.\\n', '\\n', '      He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he\\n', '      went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with\\n', '      her husband.\\n', '\\n', '      After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word\\n', '      passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went\\n', '      to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,\\n', '      unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,\\n', '      however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have\\n', '      taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.\\n', '\\n', '      Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet\\n', '      spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was\\n', '      much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was\\n', '      nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his\\n', '      ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more\\n', '      communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen\\n', '      him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the\\n', '      evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get every\\n', '      body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\\n', '      to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon\\n', '      after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,\\n', '      she could not be wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\\n', '\\n', '      But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was\\n', '      finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to\\n', '      fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening\\n', '      the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together\\n', '      over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had\\n', '      this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily\\n', '      turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it\\n', '      all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she thought\\n', '      was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\\n', '      Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who\\n', '      as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering\\n', '      a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\\n', '\\n', '      Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence\\n', '      would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged,\\n', '      with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in\\n', '      the world.\\n', '\\n', '      “’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve\\n', '      it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a\\n', '      warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every\\n', '      sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But\\n', '      she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half\\n', '      that remained to be said for the present.\\n', '\\n', '      “I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on\\n', '      any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her\\n', '      to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father\\n', '      already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give\\n', '      such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much\\n', '      happiness!”\\n', '\\n', '      She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up\\n', '      the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity\\n', '      and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given\\n', '      them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.\\n', '\\n', '      “And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\\n', '      circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance!\\n', '      the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”\\n', '\\n', '      In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with\\n', '      her father had been short and to the purpose.\\n', '\\n', '      “Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\\n', '\\n', '      “With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare\\n', '      say.”\\n', '\\n', '      He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good\\n', '      wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily\\n', '      expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They\\n', '      shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came\\n', '      down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own\\n', '      happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his being a\\n', '      lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity\\n', '      to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the\\n', '      excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane,\\n', '      and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\\n', '      himself.\\n', '\\n', '      It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the\\n', '      satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet\\n', '      animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.\\n', '      Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation\\n', '      in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked\\n', '      to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet\\n', '      joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how\\n', '      really happy he was.\\n', '\\n', '      Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till\\n', '      their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was\\n', '      gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:\\n', '\\n', '      “Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\\n', '      goodness.\\n', '\\n', '      “You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\\n', '      thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of\\n', '      your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means\\n', '      unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever\\n', '      be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and\\n', '      so generous, that you will always exceed your income.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters\\n', '      would be unpardonable in _me_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what\\n', '      are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and\\n', '      very likely more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear,\\n', '      dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep\\n', '      all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,\\n', '      at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I\\n', '      remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into\\n', '      Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you\\n', '      should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\\n', '      ever was seen!”\\n', '\\n', '      Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition\\n', '      her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her\\n', '      younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects\\n', '      of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.\\n', '\\n', '      Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and\\n', '      Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\\n', '\\n', '      Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at\\n', '      Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always\\n', '      remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous\\n', '      neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an\\n', '      invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her\\n', '      sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow\\n', '      on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both\\n', '      of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.\\n', '      In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth,\\n', '      for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone,\\n', '      Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\\n', '\\n', '      “He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me\\n', '      that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I\\n', '      had not believed it possible.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account\\n', '      for it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no\\n', '      friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,\\n', '      since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many\\n', '      respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their\\n', '      brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we\\n', '      shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once\\n', '      were to each other.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I\\n', '      ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see\\n', '      you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last\\n', '      November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of\\n', '      _my_ being indifferent would have prevented his coming down\\n', '      again!”\\n', '\\n', '      “He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of\\n', '      his modesty.”\\n', '\\n', '      This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his\\n', '      diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good\\n', '      qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed\\n', '      the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most\\n', '      generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a\\n', '      circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\\n', '\\n', '      “I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!”\\n', '      cried Jane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and\\n', '      blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there\\n', '      were but such another man for you!”\\n', '\\n', '      “If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy\\n', '      as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can\\n', '      have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,\\n', '      perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.\\n', '      Collins in time.”\\n', '\\n', '      The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be\\n', '      long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.\\n', '      Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the\\n', '      same by all her neighbours in Meryton.\\n', '\\n', '      The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in\\n', '      the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first\\n', '      run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for\\n', '      misfortune.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 56\\n', '\\n', '      One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane\\n', '      had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting\\n', '      together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn\\n', '      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a\\n', '      chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the\\n', '      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to\\n', '      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and\\n', '      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded\\n', '      it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\\n', '      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet\\n', '      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with\\n', '      him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of\\n', '      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,\\n', '      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was\\n', '      Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\\n', '\\n', '      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\\n', '      astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them,\\n', '      even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\\n', '\\n', '      She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,\\n', '      made no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight\\n', '      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.\\n', '      Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship’s\\n', '      entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of\\n', '      such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.\\n', '      After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to\\n', '      Elizabeth,\\n', '\\n', '      “I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\\n', '      mother.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\\n', '\\n', '      “And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady\\n', '      Catherine. “She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all\\n', '      is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,\\n', '      walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part\\n', '      of the family.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after\\n', '      a short silence.\\n', '\\n', '      “It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but\\n', '      I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,\\n', '      in summer; the windows are full west.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner,\\n', '      and then added:\\n', '\\n', '      “May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left\\n', '      Mr. and Mrs. Collins well.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her\\n', '      from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her\\n', '      calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take\\n', '      some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not\\n', '      very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,\\n', '      said to Elizabeth,\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little\\n', '      wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a\\n', '      turn in it, if you will favour me with your company.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the\\n', '      different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\\n', '      attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\\n', '      hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\\n', '      drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\\n', '      decent looking rooms, walked on.\\n', '\\n', '      Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\\n', '      waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the\\n', '      gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to\\n', '      make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more\\n', '      than usually insolent and disagreeable.\\n', '\\n', '      “How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she\\n', '      looked in her face.\\n', '\\n', '      As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the\\n', '      following manner:—\\n', '\\n', '      “You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of\\n', '      my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell\\n', '      you why I come.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to\\n', '      account for the honour of seeing you here.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought\\n', '      to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere\\n', '      _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character\\n', '      has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in\\n', '      a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from\\n', '      it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I\\n', '      was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most\\n', '      advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,\\n', '      would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,\\n', '      my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous\\n', '      falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose\\n', '      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for\\n', '      this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth,\\n', '      colouring with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the\\n', '      trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by\\n', '      it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “At once to insist upon having such a report universally\\n', '      contradicted.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said\\n', '      Elizabeth coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if,\\n', '      indeed, such a report is in existence.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\\n', '      industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such\\n', '      a report is spread abroad?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I never heard that it was.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for\\n', '      it?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.\\n', '      _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being\\n', '      satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of\\n', '      his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of\\n', '      infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to\\n', '      all his family. You may have drawn him in.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to\\n', '      such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in\\n', '      the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour\\n', '      as this, ever induce me to be explicit.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\\n', '      presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy\\n', '      is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose\\n', '      he will make an offer to me.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\\n', '\\n', '      “The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their\\n', '      infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the\\n', '      favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in\\n', '      their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when\\n', '      the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their\\n', '      marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of\\n', '      no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do\\n', '      you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit\\n', '      engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\\n', '      propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his\\n', '      earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there\\n', '      is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall\\n', '      certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt\\n', '      wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you\\n', '      could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on\\n', '      others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination\\n', '      confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And\\n', '      if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.\\n', '      Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by\\n', '      his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the\\n', '      inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and\\n', '      despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a\\n', '      disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.”\\n', '\\n', '      “These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife\\n', '      of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness\\n', '      necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the\\n', '      whole, have no cause to repine.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your\\n', '      gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to\\n', '      me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss\\n', '      Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of\\n', '      carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not\\n', '      been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the\\n', '      habit of brooking disappointment.”\\n', '\\n', '      “_That_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more\\n', '      pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and\\n', '      my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the\\n', '      maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s,\\n', '      from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though\\n', '      untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They\\n', '      are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their\\n', '      respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart\\n', '      pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or\\n', '      fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If\\n', '      you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit\\n', '      the sphere in which you have been brought up.”\\n', '\\n', '      “In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as\\n', '      quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s\\n', '      daughter; so far we are equal.”\\n', '\\n', '      “True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother?\\n', '      Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of\\n', '      their condition.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew\\n', '      does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”\\n', '\\n', '      Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\\n', '      Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say,\\n', '      after a moment’s deliberation:\\n', '\\n', '      “I am not.”\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine seemed pleased.\\n', '\\n', '      “And will you promise me, never to enter into such an\\n', '      engagement?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I will make no promise of the kind.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a\\n', '      more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a\\n', '      belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have\\n', '      given me the assurance I require.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be\\n', '      intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship\\n', '      wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you\\n', '      the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more\\n', '      probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing\\n', '      to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?\\n', '      Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which\\n', '      you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\\n', '      frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely\\n', '      mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such\\n', '      persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your\\n', '      interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have\\n', '      certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,\\n', '      therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\\n', '      objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I\\n', '      am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s\\n', '      infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying\\n', '      her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and\\n', '      uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_\\n', '      husband, who is the son of his late father’s steward, to be his\\n', '      brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the\\n', '      shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”\\n', '\\n', '      “You can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully\\n', '      answered. “You have insulted me in every possible method. I must\\n', '      beg to return to the house.”\\n', '\\n', '      And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they\\n', '      turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\\n', '\\n', '      “You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my\\n', '      nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a\\n', '      connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my\\n', '      sentiments.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You are then resolved to have him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that\\n', '      manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,\\n', '      without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly\\n', '      unconnected with me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey\\n', '      the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to\\n', '      ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the\\n', '      contempt of the world.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth,\\n', '      “have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No\\n', '      principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.\\n', '      Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the\\n', '      indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his\\n', '      marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the\\n', '      world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very\\n', '      well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,\\n', '      that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I\\n', '      hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry\\n', '      my point.”\\n', '\\n', '      In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the\\n', '      door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I\\n', '      take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\\n', '      mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously\\n', '      displeased.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\\n', '      ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it\\n', '      herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up\\n', '      stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the\\n', '      dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again\\n', '      and rest herself.\\n', '\\n', '      “She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”\\n', '\\n', '      “She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was\\n', '      prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the\\n', '      Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say,\\n', '      and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call\\n', '      on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you,\\n', '      Lizzy?”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to\\n', '      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 57\\n', '\\n', '      The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\\n', '      Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for\\n', '      many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady\\n', '      Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this\\n', '      journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her\\n', '      supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to\\n', '      be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could\\n', '      originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she\\n', '      recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and\\n', '      _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\\n', '      expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to\\n', '      supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the\\n', '      marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.\\n', '      And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their\\n', '      communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had\\n', '      reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost\\n', '      certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as\\n', '      possible at some future time.\\n', '\\n', '      In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not\\n', '      help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of\\n', '      her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of\\n', '      her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to\\n', '      Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew;\\n', '      and how he might take a similar representation of the evils\\n', '      attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She\\n', '      knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his\\n', '      dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he\\n', '      thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\\n', '      was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with\\n', '      _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own,\\n', '      his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions\\n', '      of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to\\n', '      Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good\\n', '      sense and solid reasoning.\\n', '\\n', '      If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had\\n', '      often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a\\n', '      relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to\\n', '      be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case\\n', '      he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way\\n', '      through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to\\n', '      Netherfield must give way.\\n', '\\n', '      “If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come\\n', '      to his friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to\\n', '      understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every\\n', '      wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting\\n', '      me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall\\n', '      soon cease to regret him at all.”\\n', '\\n', '      The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their\\n', '      visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied\\n', '      it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on\\n', '      the subject.\\n', '\\n', '      The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her\\n', '      father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my\\n', '      room.”\\n', '\\n', '      She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had\\n', '      to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in\\n', '      some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck\\n', '      her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated\\n', '      with dismay all the consequent explanations.\\n', '\\n', '      She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat\\n', '      down. He then said,\\n', '\\n', '      “I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\\n', '      exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to\\n', '      know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_\\n', '      daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a\\n', '      very important conquest.”\\n', '\\n', '      The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the\\n', '      instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,\\n', '      instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be\\n', '      pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his\\n', '      letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father\\n', '      continued:\\n', '\\n', '      “You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such\\n', '      matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to\\n', '      discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.\\n', '      Collins.”\\n', '\\n', '      “From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\\n', '      congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest\\n', '      daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the\\n', '      good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your\\n', '      impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates\\n', '      to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus offered you the sincere\\n', '      congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event,\\n', '      let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which\\n', '      we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\\n', '      Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,\\n', '      after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of\\n', '      her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most\\n', '      illustrious personages in this land.’\\n', '\\n', '      “Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young\\n', '      gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the\\n', '      heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble\\n', '      kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these\\n', '      temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of\\n', '      what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this\\n', '      gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to\\n', '      take immediate advantage of.’\\n', '\\n', '      “Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it\\n', '      comes out:\\n', '\\n', '      “‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to\\n', '      imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on\\n', '      the match with a friendly eye.’\\n', '\\n', '      “_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\\n', '      surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man\\n', '      within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have\\n', '      given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy,\\n', '      who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who\\n', '      probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could\\n', '      only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been\\n', '      directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.\\n', '\\n', '      “Are you not diverted?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! yes. Pray read on.”\\n', '\\n', '      “‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her\\n', '      ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual\\n', '      condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it\\n', '      became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on\\n', '      the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what\\n', '      she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give\\n', '      the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her\\n', '      noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\\n', '      hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’\\n', '      Mr. Collins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin\\n', '      Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only\\n', '      concerned that their living together before the marriage took\\n', '      place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect\\n', '      the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement\\n', '      at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as\\n', '      soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and\\n', '      had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously\\n', '      have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a\\n', '      Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\\n', '      names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of\\n', '      Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his\\n', '      dear Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young\\n', '      olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.\\n', '      You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be\\n', '      affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make\\n', '      sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so\\n', '      strange!”\\n', '\\n', '      “Yes—_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other\\n', '      man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference,\\n', '      and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much\\n', '      as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s\\n', '      correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter\\n', '      of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over\\n', '      Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my\\n', '      son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this\\n', '      report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”\\n', '\\n', '      To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as\\n', '      it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not\\n', '      distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at\\n', '      a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was\\n', '      necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father\\n', '      had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy’s\\n', '      indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want\\n', '      of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too\\n', '      _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 58\\n', '\\n', '      Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,\\n', '      as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to\\n', '      bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed\\n', '      after Lady Catherine’s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,\\n', '      before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his\\n', '      aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who\\n', '      wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It\\n', '      was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary\\n', '      could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.\\n', '      Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip\\n', '      them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were\\n', '      to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty\\n', '      was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly\\n', '      forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the\\n', '      same.\\n', '\\n', '      They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call\\n', '      upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a\\n', '      general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him\\n', '      alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and,\\n', '      while her courage was high, she immediately said:\\n', '\\n', '      “Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of\\n', '      giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be\\n', '      wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your\\n', '      unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known\\n', '      it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully\\n', '      I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not\\n', '      have merely my own gratitude to express.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of\\n', '      surprise and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what\\n', '      may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not\\n', '      think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first\\n', '      betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of\\n', '      course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me\\n', '      thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that\\n', '      generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,\\n', '      and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering\\n', '      them.”\\n', '\\n', '      “If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself\\n', '      alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force\\n', '      to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to\\n', '      deny. But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I\\n', '      believe I thought only of _you_.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short\\n', '      pause, her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with\\n', '      me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me\\n', '      so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one\\n', '      word from you will silence me on this subject for ever.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and\\n', '      anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and\\n', '      immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand\\n', '      that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the\\n', '      period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude\\n', '      and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this\\n', '      reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before;\\n', '      and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\\n', '      warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had\\n', '      Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how\\n', '      well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face,\\n', '      became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and\\n', '      he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she\\n', '      was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.\\n', '\\n', '      They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too\\n', '      much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any\\n', '      other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their\\n', '      present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_\\n', '      call on him in her return through London, and there relate her\\n', '      journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her\\n', '      conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every\\n', '      expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,\\n', '      peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief\\n', '      that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that\\n', '      promise from her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But,\\n', '      unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly\\n', '      contrariwise.\\n', '\\n', '      “It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed\\n', '      myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be\\n', '      certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided\\n', '      against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,\\n', '      frankly and openly.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know\\n', '      enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After\\n', '      abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple\\n', '      in abusing you to all your relations.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\\n', '      accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my\\n', '      behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It\\n', '      was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\\n', '\\n', '      “We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to\\n', '      that evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if\\n', '      strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we\\n', '      have both, I hope, improved in civility.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of\\n', '      what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions\\n', '      during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,\\n', '      inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I\\n', '      shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike\\n', '      manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely\\n', '      conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I\\n', '      confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong\\n', '      an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever\\n', '      felt in such a way.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every\\n', '      proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I\\n', '      shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed\\n', '      you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not\\n', '      do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily\\n', '      ashamed of it.”\\n', '\\n', '      Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make\\n', '      you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit\\n', '      to its contents?”\\n', '\\n', '      She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually\\n', '      all her former prejudices had been removed.\\n', '\\n', '      “I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it\\n', '      was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was\\n', '      one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your\\n', '      having the power of reading again. I can remember some\\n', '      expressions which might justly make you hate me.”\\n', '\\n', '      “The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential\\n', '      to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason\\n', '      to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I\\n', '      hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.”\\n', '\\n', '      “When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself\\n', '      perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was\\n', '      written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.”\\n', '\\n', '      “The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.\\n', '      The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The\\n', '      feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,\\n', '      are now so widely different from what they were then, that every\\n', '      unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You\\n', '      must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its\\n', '      remembrance gives you pleasure.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\\n', '      retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the\\n', '      contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is\\n', '      much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful\\n', '      recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be\\n', '      repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,\\n', '      though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was\\n', '      _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given\\n', '      good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\\n', '      Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was\\n', '      spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,\\n', '      particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,\\n', '      encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to\\n', '      care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all\\n', '      the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of\\n', '      their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from\\n', '      eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but\\n', '      for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You\\n', '      taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.\\n', '      By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of\\n', '      my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\\n', '      pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you\\n', '      to be wishing, expecting my addresses.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I\\n', '      assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might\\n', '      often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_\\n', '      evening?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began\\n', '      to take a proper direction.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met\\n', '      at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\\n', '\\n', '      “No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed\\n', '      by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary\\n', '      politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_\\n', '      than my due.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every\\n', '      civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the\\n', '      past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill\\n', '      opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended\\n', '      to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly\\n', '      tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.”\\n', '\\n', '      He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and\\n', '      of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally\\n', '      leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that\\n', '      his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her\\n', '      sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his\\n', '      gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other\\n', '      struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.\\n', '\\n', '      She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a\\n', '      subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.\\n', '\\n', '      After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy\\n', '      to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their\\n', '      watches, that it was time to be at home.\\n', '\\n', '      “What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which\\n', '      introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted\\n', '      with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest\\n', '      information of it.\\n', '\\n', '      “I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      “Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”\\n', '\\n', '      “That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as\\n', '      much.” And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had\\n', '      been pretty much the case.\\n', '\\n', '      “On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\\n', '      confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.\\n', '      I told him of all that had occurred to make my former\\n', '      interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise\\n', '      was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him,\\n', '      moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had\\n', '      done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could\\n', '      easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt\\n', '      no doubt of their happiness together.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing\\n', '      his friend.\\n', '\\n', '      “Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you\\n', '      told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information\\n', '      last spring?”\\n', '\\n', '      “From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two\\n', '      visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her\\n', '      affection.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate\\n', '      conviction to him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\\n', '      prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case,\\n', '      but his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to\\n', '      confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended\\n', '      him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had\\n', '      been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and\\n', '      purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am\\n', '      persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your\\n', '      sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most\\n', '      delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was\\n', '      invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had\\n', '      yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to\\n', '      begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course\\n', '      was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation\\n', '      till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 59\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a\\n', '      question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she\\n', '      entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to\\n', '      table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered\\n', '      about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she\\n', '      spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion\\n', '      of the truth.\\n', '\\n', '      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.\\n', '      The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged\\n', '      were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness\\n', '      overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather\\n', '      _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,\\n', '      besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils\\n', '      before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when\\n', '      her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him\\n', '      but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_\\n', '      which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\\n', '\\n', '      At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very\\n', '      far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely\\n', '      incredulous here.\\n', '\\n', '      “You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,\\n', '      no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”\\n', '\\n', '      “This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on\\n', '      you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.\\n', '      Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He\\n', '      still loves me, and we are engaged.”\\n', '\\n', '      Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know\\n', '      how much you dislike him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.\\n', '      Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in\\n', '      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the\\n', '      last time I shall ever remember it myself.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\\n', '      seriously assured her of its truth.\\n', '\\n', '      “Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,”\\n', '      cried Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate\\n', '      you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite\\n', '      certain that you can be happy with him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,\\n', '      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you\\n', '      pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself\\n', '      more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as\\n', '      impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh,\\n', '      Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you\\n', '      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,\\n', '      when I tell you all.”\\n', '\\n', '      “What do you mean?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I\\n', '      am afraid you will be angry.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very\\n', '      seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without\\n', '      delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?”\\n', '\\n', '      “It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it\\n', '      began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his\\n', '      beautiful grounds at Pemberley.”\\n', '\\n', '      Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\\n', '      desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn\\n', '      assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss\\n', '      Bennet had nothing further to wish.\\n', '\\n', '      “Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as\\n', '      myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his\\n', '      love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as\\n', '      Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and\\n', '      yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very\\n', '      reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at\\n', '      Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,\\n', '      not to you.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been\\n', '      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own\\n', '      feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But\\n', '      now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia’s\\n', '      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in\\n', '      conversation.\\n', '\\n', '      “Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the\\n', '      next morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here\\n', '      again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so\\n', '      tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he\\n', '      would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us\\n', '      with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk\\n', '      out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s way.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;\\n', '      yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him\\n', '      such an epithet.\\n', '\\n', '      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively,\\n', '      and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good\\n', '      information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet,\\n', '      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way\\n', '      again to-day?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to\\n', '      walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and\\n', '      Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.”\\n', '\\n', '      “It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I\\n', '      am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty\\n', '      owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\\n', '      curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\\n', '      consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet\\n', '      followed her, saying:\\n', '\\n', '      “I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\\n', '      disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind\\n', '      it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion\\n', '      for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put\\n', '      yourself to inconvenience.”\\n', '\\n', '      During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent\\n', '      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved\\n', '      to herself the application for her mother’s. She could not\\n', '      determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting\\n', '      whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome\\n', '      her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set\\n', '      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain\\n', '      that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her\\n', '      sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\\n', '      first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\\n', '      disapprobation.\\n', '\\n', '      In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,\\n', '      she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on\\n', '      seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition,\\n', '      but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be\\n', '      through her means—that _she_, his favourite child, should be\\n', '      distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears\\n', '      and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and\\n', '      she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at\\n', '      him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he\\n', '      approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\\n', '      pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your\\n', '      father, he wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\\n', '\\n', '      Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\\n', '      “Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your\\n', '      senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\\n', '\\n', '      How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been\\n', '      more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have\\n', '      spared her from explanations and professions which it was\\n', '      exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she\\n', '      assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\\n', '\\n', '      “Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich,\\n', '      to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages\\n', '      than Jane. But will they make you happy?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief\\n', '      of my indifference?”\\n', '\\n', '      “None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of\\n', '      man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\\n', '\\n', '      “I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I\\n', '      love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly\\n', '      amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain\\n', '      me by speaking of him in such terms.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the\\n', '      kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,\\n', '      which he condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are\\n', '      resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of\\n', '      it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be\\n', '      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your\\n', '      husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively\\n', '      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal\\n', '      marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My\\n', '      child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to\\n', '      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her\\n', '      reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was\\n', '      really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change\\n', '      which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute\\n', '      certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had\\n', '      stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with\\n', '      energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father’s\\n', '      incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\\n', '\\n', '      “Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no\\n', '      more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not\\n', '      have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\\n', '\\n', '      To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr.\\n', '      Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with\\n', '      astonishment.\\n', '\\n', '      “This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every\\n', '      thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s\\n', '      debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will\\n', '      save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s\\n', '      doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young\\n', '      lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him\\n', '      to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and\\n', '      there will be an end of the matter.”\\n', '\\n', '      He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his\\n', '      reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some\\n', '      time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room,\\n', '      “If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am\\n', '      quite at leisure.”\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,\\n', '      after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was\\n', '      able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was\\n', '      too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;\\n', '      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the\\n', '      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.\\n', '\\n', '      When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she\\n', '      followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect\\n', '      was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat\\n', '      quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under\\n', '      many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard;\\n', '      though not in general backward to credit what was for the\\n', '      advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to\\n', '      any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\\n', '      her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\\n', '\\n', '      “Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!\\n', '      Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest\\n', '      Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what\\n', '      jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to\\n', '      it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming\\n', '      man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for\\n', '      my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook\\n', '      it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is\\n', '      charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!\\n', '      What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”\\n', '\\n', '      This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be\\n', '      doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard\\n', '      only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three\\n', '      minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.\\n', '\\n', '      “My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten\\n', '      thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord!\\n', '      And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special\\n', '      licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is\\n', '      particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow.”\\n', '\\n', '      This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the\\n', '      gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in\\n', '      the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of\\n', '      her relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished\\n', '      for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for\\n', '      Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law\\n', '      that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power\\n', '      to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his\\n', '      opinion.\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains\\n', '      to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that\\n', '      he was rising every hour in his esteem.\\n', '\\n', '      “I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham,\\n', '      perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband\\n', '      quite as well as Jane’s.”\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 60\\n', '\\n', '      Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted\\n', '      Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.\\n', '      “How could you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on\\n', '      charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could\\n', '      set you off in the first place?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the\\n', '      words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in\\n', '      the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.”\\n', '\\n', '      “My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my\\n', '      behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,\\n', '      and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain\\n', '      than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”\\n', '\\n', '      “For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little\\n', '      less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,\\n', '      of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who\\n', '      were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_\\n', '      approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so\\n', '      unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have\\n', '      hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise\\n', '      yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your\\n', '      heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously\\n', '      courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for\\n', '      it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it\\n', '      perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of\\n', '      me—but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while\\n', '      she was ill at Netherfield?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a\\n', '      virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your\\n', '      protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;\\n', '      and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing\\n', '      and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin\\n', '      directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the\\n', '      point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,\\n', '      and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did\\n', '      you look as if you did not care about me?”\\n', '\\n', '      “Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no\\n', '      encouragement.”\\n', '\\n', '      “But I was embarrassed.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And so was I.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”\\n', '\\n', '      “A man who had felt less, might.”\\n', '\\n', '      “How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,\\n', '      and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder\\n', '      how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to\\n', '      yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not\\n', '      asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to\\n', '      Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for\\n', '      what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach\\n', '      of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This\\n', '      will never do.”\\n', '\\n', '      “You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly\\n', '      fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us\\n', '      were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for\\n', '      my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your\\n', '      gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of\\n', '      yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was\\n', '      determined at once to know every thing.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her\\n', '      happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come\\n', '      down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and\\n', '      be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious\\n', '      consequence?”\\n', '\\n', '      “My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,\\n', '      whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or\\n', '      what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were\\n', '      still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession\\n', '      to him which I have since made.”\\n', '\\n', '      “Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what\\n', '      is to befall her?”\\n', '\\n', '      “I am more likely to want  time than courage, Elizabeth. But it\\n', '      ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it\\n', '      shall be done directly.”\\n', '\\n', '      “And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you\\n', '      and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady\\n', '      once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer\\n', '      neglected.”\\n', '\\n', '      From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr.\\n', '      Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.\\n', '      Gardiner’s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate\\n', '      which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to\\n', '      find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of\\n', '      happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:\\n', '\\n', '      “I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to\\n', '      have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of\\n', '      particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You\\n', '      supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as\\n', '      you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your\\n', '      imagination in every possible flight which the subject will\\n', '      afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot\\n', '      greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a\\n', '      great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and\\n', '      again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to\\n', '      wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round\\n', '      the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.\\n', '      Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such\\n', '      justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.\\n', '      Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare\\n', '      from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,\\n', '      etc.”\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;\\n', '      and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.\\n', '      Collins, in reply to his last.\\n', '\\n', '      “Dear Sir,\\n', '      “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will\\n', '      soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\\n', '      you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\\n', '      more to give.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yours sincerely, etc.”\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\\n', '      marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote\\n', '      even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat\\n', '      all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but\\n', '      she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could\\n', '      not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was\\n', '      deserved.\\n', '\\n', '      The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar\\n', '      information, was as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four\\n', '      sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and\\n', '      all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.\\n', '\\n', '      Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any\\n', '      congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family\\n', '      heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The\\n', '      reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine\\n', '      had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her\\n', '      nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,\\n', '      was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a\\n', '      moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to\\n', '      Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must\\n', '      sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr.\\n', '      Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\\n', '      husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could\\n', '      even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on\\n', '      carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed\\n', '      his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with\\n', '      very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not\\n', '      till Sir William was out of sight.\\n', '\\n', '      Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax\\n', '      on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her\\n', '      sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the\\n', '      familiarity which Bingley’s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever\\n', '      she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him,\\n', '      though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more\\n', '      elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the\\n', '      frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to\\n', '      herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\\n', '      without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\\n', '      arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of\\n', '      its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked\\n', '      forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from\\n', '      society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and\\n', '      elegance of their family party at Pemberley.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 61\\n', '\\n', '      Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what\\n', '      delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked\\n', '      of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake\\n', '      of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in\\n', '      the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an\\n', '      effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman\\n', '      for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her\\n', '      husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so\\n', '      unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and\\n', '      invariably silly.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection\\n', '      for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do.\\n', '      He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least\\n', '      expected.\\n', '\\n', '      Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.\\n', '      So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not\\n', '      desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.\\n', '      The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an\\n', '      estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and\\n', '      Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were\\n', '      within thirty miles of each other.\\n', '\\n', '      Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her\\n', '      time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what\\n', '      she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not\\n', '      of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the\\n', '      influence of Lydia’s example, she became, by proper attention and\\n', '      management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From\\n', '      the further disadvantage of Lydia’s society she was of course\\n', '      carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to\\n', '      come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men,\\n', '      her father would never consent to her going.\\n', '\\n', '      Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was\\n', '      necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.\\n', '      Bennet’s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix\\n', '      more with the world, but she could still moralize over every\\n', '      morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons\\n', '      between her sisters’ beauty and her own, it was suspected by her\\n', '      father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.\\n', '\\n', '      As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution\\n', '      from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the\\n', '      conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with\\n', '      whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown\\n', '      to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope\\n', '      that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The\\n', '      congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her\\n', '      marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by\\n', '      himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\\n', '      effect:\\n', '\\n', '      “My dear Lizzy,\\n', '      “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my\\n', '      dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to\\n', '      have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope\\n', '      you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at\\n', '      court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money\\n', '      enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of\\n', '      about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to\\n', '      Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.\\n', '\\n', '      “Yours, etc.”\\n', '\\n', '      As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she\\n', '      endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and\\n', '      expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her\\n', '      power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy\\n', '      in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had\\n', '      always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under\\n', '      the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and\\n', '      heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their\\n', '      support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\\n', '      herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance\\n', '      towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even\\n', '      when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was\\n', '      unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to\\n', '      place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more\\n', '      than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into\\n', '      indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her\\n', '      youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation\\n', '      which her marriage had given her.\\n', '\\n', '      Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for\\n', '      Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession.\\n', '      Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone\\n', '      to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they\\n', '      both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley’s good\\n', '      humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of\\n', '      giving them a hint to be gone.\\n', '\\n', '      Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but\\n', '      as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at\\n', '      Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of\\n', '      Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid\\n', '      off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.\\n', '\\n', '      Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the\\n', '      sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able\\n', '      to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had\\n', '      the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first\\n', '      she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her\\n', '      lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had\\n', '      always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her\\n', '      affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind\\n', '      received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By\\n', '      Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman\\n', '      may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not\\n', '      always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than\\n', '      himself.\\n', '\\n', '      Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her\\n', '      nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her\\n', '      character in her reply to the letter which announced its\\n', '      arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of\\n', '      Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But\\n', '      at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he was prevailed on to\\n', '      overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a\\n', '      little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment\\n', '      gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to\\n', '      see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait\\n', '      on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods\\n', '      had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,\\n', '      but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\\n', '\\n', '      With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.\\n', '      Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were\\n', '      both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons\\n', '      who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of\\n', '      uniting them.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ***\\n', '\\n', 'Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\n', 'be renamed.\\n', '\\n', 'Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\n', 'law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\n', 'so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\n', 'United States without permission and without paying copyright\\n', 'royalties.
